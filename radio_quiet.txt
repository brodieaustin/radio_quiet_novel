A DIVORCE

What was the follow up to "I'm leaving you?" He could have said any number of things--and maybe he wanted to any one of them--but didn't. But she didn't want him to say anything. For both of them, the words and the finality they conveyed were a relief. And why not? Martha had lived with his disbelief for so many years now that it felt good to have a message sent from sender to receiver and just be...received.

But about that disbelief? What happened to it when she spoke those words and conveyed that message. Where did those years of disbelief and the repetoire of gestures, looks, and sounds that he had crafted go? She wasn't sure for several minutes as he stood by the kitchen counter chopping celery on the counter. He kept cutting through the succulent network of tubes a few more times, wiped his hands and turned to look at her. She didn't repeat herself; he merely nodded.

The celery, for what it's worth, went into a bowl of boiled eggs that he made into egg salad for a quick dinner. They were always eating quick dinners--Martha and Greg. Martha had aura cleaning to attend to that night. The sessions were held just down the alley and around the corner. Greg dutifully made egg salad since dinners had become his domain after losing his job over 18 months ago.

Martha, however, held her job at the university, but rushed off most evenings to workshops, clinics, or doctors appointments. One thing or another. Greg kept making grilled cheese or egg salad and trying not to think too much about it.

Maybe his disbelief--what from her perspective was his stubborn refusal--over her mysterious symptoms and illnesses was just channeled back into the egg salad. But she watched him once he turned back. He didn't seem tense. He didn't "accidentally" chop his finger off--which would have led to what exactly? Reconciliation? No, she could no longer face his blunt, cold stare day after day. She was dying inside and needed relief. Greg could not give her this relief.

No person could. This was a realization that she had finally come to some months back. She couldn't remember when exactly. Maybe it was after the third failed cleansing, or after a particularly long weekend retreat that invovled a particuarly grueling session in sweat lodge. None of the teas and compounds she had ingested made her feel better. None of the meditation practices could quiet the restless feeling inside of her that something was moving through her, killing her, and would overtake her eventually.

Marriage, at least some version of it, is a pact in the face of the world betwen two people. Martha and Greg had married at a young age and thought they knew what the countours of that world were. That pact stands against the world in some ways, feels like an agreement to stand in defiance of this more or that custom. But over time, people like Martha and Greg come to realize that, in fact, marriage is a slow reconcialliation with the world. That you learn how to reincorporate yourself into it.

So what happens when the world itself becomes antagonistic to a participant in that pact? Or when the notion of what a world is changes beyond recognition for one person? Surely the pact must dissolve. And so it did for Martha and Greg.

That night, at the aura cleaning, Martha sat silently in a beige garden level room looking out on a stub of street--occaisonaly cars passed by but the atmosphere in the room, for those inside, was one of serentiy and removal. Martha sat through the aura cleansing even as her raged with pain. That pain seemed to somehow invade her stomach, making her feel sick inside.

Afterwards, the only person that she really knew who attended these sessions, came up to her and asked her about "her plan."

"I'm leaving in two weeks," Martha replied.

"So soon?" said the person.

"Does it seem soon? Funny I feel like I've prepared for it for a while."

"How is your husband taking it?"

"He seems fine with it."

"I heard a story about Ruston a few days ago, incidentally. They talked about all of the refugees moving there."

"Refugees?"

"Yeah, that was the word they used..."

Martha took the word inside and didn't really make much of it. Was she a refugee? She hadn't thought of it that way before. Beacuse of that, the idea fell away from the central force of the idea, the "plan" as it had been called. In two weeks, she would move to a small town called Ruston, West Virginia, to the radio quiet zone.

***

When she gave her notice at work, Martha didn't go into details. Rather she went into details but none of the pertinent ones. No, in fact, she gave completley fabricated details, convincing details, but details with no substance to them. Had Martha been a different person and in a different state of mind, the "details" she gave might have been called a delusion. She told her boss that her husband accepted a job in West Virginia--it was a good opportunity--it couldn't be passed up--she felt compelled to move--and so on. Meanwhile Greg was probably at home peeling potatos for dinner or simply sitting.

But the details made a compelling case for the urgency behind her request to resign. Really her boss was relieved, Martha had only been an adequate worker anyone--rarely showing much ambibition or drive. She had not advanced beyond being an advanced administrative assistant in the engineering college's offices. She always seemed to be ducking out for doctor's appointments, and recently seemed very antagonitistic towards the young graduate students and researchers--particualry anyone who dealt with anything involving waves or radiation.

Martha's mother had been a hippy, but now was a dead hippy, which was more or less fine for Martha. The stories her mother told about living day to day and not caring about the material world while they scrambled to get rent payments together had not conveyed the intended message to her daughter. But now, Martha found herself trying to recount and reimagine some of those stories. She marvelled, in fact, that she was quitting her job, leaving her husband and moving somewhere with no job, no steady place to live, and no real sense of the path.

The path outlined by the plan only led as far as the loding house in Ruston. Beyond that there simply was no plan. Martha's sense of wonder about this reminded her of her mother, but almost as a visitation or haunting does, only Martha felt the hautning on the inside. A part of her mother had surfaced inside her when she had least expected it.

Had she asked, Greg probably could have outlined other similarities between Martha and the woman he had known briefly as his mother-in-law. But he never bothered to do so; and she had never bothered to ask.


WAKING UP IN METAL

The echo of her own snores still startled her in the morning sometimes. The cot she slept on creaked, and sometimes, in throws of a nightmare, she would lash out and begin banging of the metal lined walls of the chamber were she was forced to sleep now. But when the banging stopped and she became lucid again Deana could only the hear muffled and still quiet around her. Then a dog would bark--maybe from next door or maybe a few block away. She might hear the faint sounds of a car passing by. The quiet came back and she would fall asleep again.

Sleeping in the chamber took getting used to. She couldn't afford to have anything large or elaborate built. A neighbor came over in the evenings for a few weeks and framed the 8 x 9 structure and covered it with layers of metal and chicken wire. The whole thing was built around a simple subfloor covered with multicolored scraps of carpet that the found from an abandoned housing development on the other side of town.

Once she moved her bed into the chamber and made the bed up with sheet edged in plaid and worn down comforter, the muffled and metallic space felt a little more inviting. She added a few more comforts--a picture, a small side table with a lamp. Soon she had to abandon the lamp as the buzz of current--and the long extenstion cord running from the house--began to bother her too. She purchased a head lamp from the army surplus store and read before bed with a beam of light extending from her forehead.

The chamber also reminded Deana of her father. He had spent several years attempting to build an elaborate bomb shelter when she was a little girl. He would sometimes come home from work and scarely could be dragged away from his digging or sawing to help with homework or read a bed time shelter. Then the obsession just dissapated, leaving a ricketly staircase to a soggy half-finished bomb shelter in the back of their yard. Years later when her father died, her older brother, Teddy, paid some day laborers $100 to strip the thing for scrap and fill the rest in with dirt. 

She remembered watching from the kitchen as the men--two Mexican migrant workers--greeted a friend who arrived that morning in a deformed pickup with tall wooden planks affixed to each side of the bed, nod grimly to one another then get to work. Within an hour, the man in the salvage truck was bouncing back through the yard to the alley and the two other men began shoveling dirt into the hole.

Whenever she thought of the shelter, she resented her brother and his aggressive handling of their father's legacy. He had dispatched, through his envoys, that part of their father's legacy, his personality, with a cold, bureacratic logic--"It's a hazard and will make the place impossible to sell." Of course, the house never did sell and only in the last few years did Teddy reluctantly agree to deed the house to her.

Was the chamber built on the exact spot of the bomb shelter? She couldn't remember its exact location. The distance between the entrace and the back stairs of the porch had warped with time. It was both closer and farther away depending on the moment when she tried to recover that piece of information. Instead, she opted to have it built near the garage, under a tree, hoping to avoid needing to pull a permit for what, as her helpful neighbor explained was "little more than a shieled TuffShed."

Deana generally couldn't hold down jobs. She was cranky, irrascible, unpersonable. Inclined to airing opinions about matters that had not, and probably would not, surface in any normal flow of conversation. She was unpleasant to be around and no one liked her much. The neighbor that helped her was probably just as odd, though Deana barely noticed the eccentricities of others. There was almost ethical quality to the way in which she accepted and dealt with the quirks of others.

Maybe her acceptance of the churlish behavior that so many people exhibit on a regular basis--their propensity to talk too much, be self-absorbed, and bound by fleeting notions of acceptable behavior--made her better in some way. Her tolerance was the very model of tolerance because the notion of tolerance hardly factored into it at all. The only flaw in this nearly flawless ethical system was that she expected the same suspension of reaction in other people as well. Unfortunately for, few people could restrain or not even experience a flutter of irritation in the face of someone endless stream of pronouncements and judgements.

So, Deana kept her expenses to a minimum. She didn't have to pay for housing now that she owned her parent's house (or what she always called her father's house, keeping the image of the bombshelter squarly in focus as she did so). She worked odd jobs; she volunteering at what ever organizations could tolerate her; and she flirted with varying types of government help.

For several months, the chamber strained her resources and Deana felt that she was going to have to find some steady work. Fortunately for her, she found a few house cleaning jobs that went at least a little way towards covering the costs. And for a while, it was good. The chamber's layers of metal and mesh seemed to keep the waves out, to dampen the impact of the radiation that was all around her. All of the disadvantages of sleeping, basically living, in a tiny shed gave way to her renwed sense of good health. 

But a few months after that, the headaches and rashes returned. Her level of irritability became even too much for her neighbor to tolerate. He had come over to check on the chamber only to find her insulting the quality of the work he had done. She complained for 15 or 20 minutes about how drafty it was, how inadequate and poorly thought out the design was. Her neighbor turned around and walked off without saying a word, leaving Deana to shrug and get back to thinking over the chamber's inadequacies.

***

She knew that the pamphlet was somewhere in the house; she just couldn't remeber where. After several months of merely passing through the house, she felt a bit disoriented to be inside of it again. The complexity of the floor, the strong angles of the doorways, the pourousness of the windows all overwhelmed her. After a few minutes of hyperventiallating in the living room, she remembered that she had stowed away the pamphlet in a dresser drawer in the guest bedroom--formerly for the guest that was her brother.

In the top drawer of that dresser, she found a gold and blue glossy pamphplet that read across the find "Wireless sickness is real...And I have the cure!" Deana had no quibble with the firs assertion of that statement; she felt more skeptical about the second. Dr. Nick Conroy's picture on the back flap did little to reassure him--a slighly crosseyed and unsmiling man stared out at her wearing a plain shirt and tie. 

Inside, though, the pamphlet advertised a refugee from the epidemic known as "wirelss sickness." The zig-zagging bulleted list of symptoms matched her own. And the photographs of the refuge being advertised seemed perfect to her. As much as she loved her father's home and the land and the memories of the bomb shelter. Deana knew that the promise held out by this pamphlet, the promise of a place called Ruston and community called "Salubrious", would sustain her in the present and future.

SALUBRIOUS

The problem never was having an idea, a vision, and momentum. Dr. Conroy could beam from one inspiration to the next with little hesitation. But he rarely followed thourhg and never completed anything. Really, there wasn't a thing in his life that he had completed. Of course, this didn't keep him from printing "Dr." or "MD" by his name. And he could have card and signs and posters and brochures printed by the hundreds and thousands. He was, in fact, very task oriented and often ruthlessly efficient at the small things. The boxes and piles of literature in his living room spoke eloquently to this point.

Dr. Conroy was a doer trapped in the wildly spun visions of a dreamer and thinker. The do parts of his personality didn't really merge until he his upon the idea of Salubrious. As with any account of truly inspired creation, though, that exact moment on inception was hard to pin down for him. But he did remember the time a year and a half ago when a defeated and worn out man came to his back-of-the-building office complaining about the waves.

The small city and the boxy office rooms in an old 1920s building with hollow sounding hallways were no where near an ocean, even a Great Lake. The place was soundly Midwestern and had the hulks of old mills and factories to prove it. Dr. Conroy poised his fingertips under his chin for a few moments before responding, "Of course, from the cell phone towers." The man's response demonstrated revealed immediately to Dr. Conroy his genius as a diagnostician.

They spent an hour or so talking over the etilogy of these symptoms. Both the man and Dr. Conroy were convinced that they were witnesses the emergence of a new disease. Had Dr. Conroy referted to the Biblical language of former years, he migth have said of a new plague or a scurge, or even a visitation, why not? It was clear to him though that this man was being assualted by the modern world. In such a world as this one, full of screens and people looking deeply into those screens, mindless of the cell degrading nature of the wave energy passing through them daily, who would step forth to protect a man like this.

After that man left, Dr. Conroy considerd him for several minutes. The man, whose name was recorded in tidy chart, was not remarkable in any particular way. Did not exhibit the accute nervous senstivities that he had read about in the classic cases of neurotics in Dr. Freud's time. No, this man might very well have been a plain American factory worker, a blue collar hero of sorts. Dr. Conroy quickly rewrote that last part--an earnest working man--who suffered from a mysterious illness.

It hardly bears stating that Dr. Conroy's regarded his professional staus very highly. He regarded himself as a fine, if misunderstood, medical mind. Of course, that midn had bent its inborn powers to religion (as mentioned), to feats of invention and engineering, to marketing and sales, and to a host of other occupations. Yet it was precisely to not be occupied that seemed to motivate many of these feats of genius. Maybe it was more correct to say that people like you or I would be likely to not appreciate the channels into which the doctor's exertions ran.

There was, in fact, a kidn of metaphysical genius to his labor and his effort. But from nothing sprang something and the doctor was able to rent an office and afford regular trips to the regional casinos. He was well dressed--not ostentatious or absurd--but he realized the value of presenting himself professionally. Attending to details often earned him the implicit trust of patients who watched for signals like freshly pressed clothes, polished shoes, and yet were hardly aware of doing so.

***

A few weeks after the man visited his office, Dr. Conroy stumbled into a series of facts that set his idea for Salubrious in motion. It started with a conversation he overheard in the coffee shop near his office. Two men were talking about aliens. The conversation verged into tin foil conspiracies--which even the doctor had'nt peddle at any point his career..yet. They referred several times to the Quiet Zone and the radio telescope housed there. One of the men wearing an orange trucker hat was point across the street trying to indicate how large the telescope was. Whether it was the notion of a quiet zone or the image of a enormous dish pointed at outspace, the doctor was preoccupied by an image of the telescope for much of the day. 

The doctor often scanned real estate listings on the internet. He felt that it was a good idea to always have a back up plan and exit strategy, just in case some one came looking for him. He had never been east for an extended period of time, and found himself looking at places in West Virginia and reading about the area. Then he circled back to a reference to the telescope and the Radio Quiet zone. Then on the screen was a listing for an old farm house just outside a place called Ruston. It seemed perfect for somethign, even though he didn't know what yet.

The man who visted his office, a listing for a farm, two men talking space and telescopes in a coffee shop--these were the ingredients that combined together in his mind and set off a series of images, little fragments of narratives--almost small movies playing out then fading out in his mind, and phrases, slogans, whole speeches that came to him. Suddenly the word "salubriuos" came to mind. He walked over to a book shelf in his office where, next to a DSM, he had an old red dictionary. He looked the word up: favorable to or promoting health or well-being.

***

A tense phone call nearly interrupted his plan.
