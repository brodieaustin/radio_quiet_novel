A DIVORCE

What was the follow up to "I'm leaving you?" He could have said any number of things--and maybe he wanted to any one of them--but didn't. But she didn't want him to say anything. For both of them, the words and the finality they conveyed were a relief. And why not? Martha had lived with his disbelief for so many years now that it felt good to have a message sent from sender to receiver and just be...received.

But about that disbelief? What happened to it when she spoke those words and conveyed that message. Where did those years of disbelief and the repetoire of gestures, looks, and sounds that he had crafted go? She wasn't sure for several minutes as he stood by the kitchen counter chopping celery on the counter. He kept cutting through the succulent network of tubes a few more times, wiped his hands and turned to look at her. She didn't repeat herself; he merely nodded.

The celery, for what it's worth, went into a bowl of boiled eggs that he made into egg salad for a quick dinner. They were always eating quick dinners--Martha and Greg. Martha had aura cleaning to attend to that night. The sessions were held just down the alley and around the corner. Greg dutifully made egg salad since dinners had become his domain after losing his job over 18 months ago.

Martha, however, held her job at the university, but rushed off most evenings to workshops, clinics, or doctors appointments. One thing or another. Greg kept making grilled cheese or egg salad and trying not to think too much about it.

Maybe his disbelief--what from her perspective was his stubborn refusal--over her mysterious symptoms and illnesses was just channeled back into the egg salad. But she watched him once he turned back. He didn't seem tense. He didn't "accidentally" chop his finger off--which would have led to what exactly? Reconciliation? No, she could no longer face his blunt, cold stare day after day. She was dying inside and needed relief. Greg could not give her this relief.

No person could. This was a realization that she had finally come to some months back. She couldn't remember when exactly. Maybe it was after the third failed cleansing, or after a particularly long weekend retreat that invovled a particuarly grueling session in sweat lodge. None of the teas and compounds she had ingested made her feel better. None of the meditation practices could quiet the restless feeling inside of her that something was moving through her, killing her, and would overtake her eventually.

Marriage, at least some version of it, is a pact in the face of the world betwen two people. Martha and Greg had married at a young age and thought they knew what the countours of that world were. That pact stands against the world in some ways, feels like an agreement to stand in defiance of this more or that custom. But over time, people like Martha and Greg come to realize that, in fact, marriage is a slow reconcialliation with the world. That you learn how to reincorporate yourself into it.

So what happens when the world itself becomes antagonistic to a participant in that pact? Or when the notion of what a world is changes beyond recognition for one person? Surely the pact must dissolve. And so it did for Martha and Greg.

That night, at the aura cleaning, Martha sat silently in a beige garden level room looking out on a stub of street--occaisonaly cars passed by but the atmosphere in the room, for those inside, was one of serentiy and removal. Martha sat through the aura cleansing even as her raged with pain. That pain seemed to somehow invade her stomach, making her feel sick inside.

Afterwards, the only person that she really knew who attended these sessions, came up to her and asked her about "her plan."

"I'm leaving in two weeks," Martha replied.

"So soon?" said the person.

"Does it seem soon? Funny I feel like I've prepared for it for a while."

"How is your husband taking it?"

"He seems fine with it."

"I heard a story about Ruston a few days ago, incidentally. They talked about all of the refugees moving there."

"Refugees?"

"Yeah, that was the word they used..."

Martha took the word inside and didn't really make much of it. Was she a refugee? She hadn't thought of it that way before. Beacuse of that, the idea fell away from the central force of the idea, the "plan" as it had been called. In two weeks, she would move to a small town called Ruston, West Virginia, to the radio quiet zone.

***

When she gave her notice at work, Martha didn't go into details. Rather she went into details but none of the pertinent ones. No, in fact, she gave completley fabricated details, convincing details, but details with no substance to them. Had Martha been a different person and in a different state of mind, the "details" she gave might have been called a delusion. She told her boss that her husband accepted a job in West Virginia--it was a good opportunity--it couldn't be passed up--she felt compelled to move--and so on. Meanwhile Greg was probably at home peeling potatos for dinner or simply sitting.

But the details made a compelling case for the urgency behind her request to resign. Really her boss was relieved, Martha had only been an adequate worker anyone--rarely showing much ambibition or drive. She had not advanced beyond being an advanced administrative assistant in the engineering college's offices. She always seemed to be ducking out for doctor's appointments, and recently seemed very antagonitistic towards the young graduate students and researchers--particualry anyone who dealt with anything involving waves or radiation.

Martha's mother had been a hippy, but now was a dead hippy, which was more or less fine for Martha. The stories her mother told about living day to day and not caring about the material world while they scrambled to get rent payments together had not conveyed the intended message to her daughter. But now, Martha found herself trying to recount and reimagine some of those stories. She marvelled, in fact, that she was quitting her job, leaving her husband and moving somewhere with no job, no steady place to live, and no real sense of the path.

The path outlined by the plan only led as far as the loding house in Ruston. Beyond that there simply was no plan. Martha's sense of wonder about this reminded her of her mother, but almost as a visitation or haunting does, only Martha felt the hautning on the inside. A part of her mother had surfaced inside her when she had least expected it.

Had she asked, Greg probably could have outlined other similarities between Martha and the woman he had known briefly as his mother-in-law. But he never bothered to do so; and she had never bothered to ask.


WAKING UP IN LEAD

The echo of her own snores still startled her in the morning sometimes. The cot she slept on creaked, and sometimes, in throws of a nightmore, she would lash out and begin banging of the lead lined walls of the chamber were she was forced to sleep now.
