# Radio Quiet Zone

## A DIVORCE

What was the follow up to "I'm leaving you?" He could have said any number of things--and maybe he wanted to any one of them--but didn't. But she didn't want him to say anything. For both of them, the words and the finality they conveyed were a relief. And why not? Martha had lived with his disbelief for so many years now that it felt good to have a message sent from sender to receiver and just be...received.

But about that disbelief? What happened to it when she spoke those words and conveyed that message. Where did those years of disbelief and the repertoire of gestures, looks, and sounds that he had crafted go? She wasn't sure for several minutes as he stood by the kitchen counter chopping celery on the counter. He kept cutting through the succulent network of tubes a few more times, wiped his hands and turned to look at her. She didn't repeat herself; he merely nodded.

The celery, for what it's worth, went into a bowl of boiled eggs that he made into egg salad for a quick dinner. They were always eating quick dinners--Martha and Greg. Martha had aura cleaning to attend to that night. The sessions were held just down the alley and around the corner. Greg dutifully made egg salad since dinners had become his domain after losing his job over 18 months ago.

Martha, however, held her job at the university, but rushed off most evenings to workshops, clinics, or doctors appointments. One thing or another. Greg kept making grilled cheese or egg salad and trying not to think too much about it.

Maybe his disbelief--what from her perspective was his stubborn refusal--over her mysterious symptoms and illnesses was just channeled back into the egg salad. But she watched him once he turned back. He didn't seem tense. He didn't "accidentally" chop his finger off--which would have led to what exactly? Reconciliation? No, she could no longer face his blunt, cold stare day after day. She was dying inside and needed relief. Greg could not give her this relief.

No person could. This was a realization that she had finally come to some months back. She couldn't remember when exactly. Maybe it was after the third failed cleansing, or after a particularly long weekend retreat that involved a particularly grueling session in sweat lodge. None of the teas and compounds she had ingested made her feel better. None of the meditation practices could quiet the restless feeling inside of her that something was moving through her, killing her, and would overtake her eventually.

Marriage, at least some version of it, is a pact in the face of the world between two people. Martha and Greg had married at a young age and thought they knew what the contours of that world were. That pact stands against the world in some ways, feels like an agreement to stand in defiance of this more or that custom. But over time, people like Martha and Greg come to realize that, in fact, marriage is a slow reconciliation with the world. That you learn how to reincorporate yourself into it.

So what happens when the world itself becomes antagonistic to a participant in that pact? Or when the notion of what a world is changes beyond recognition for one person? Surely the pact must dissolve. And so it did for Martha and Greg.

***

That night, at the aura cleaning, Martha sat silently in a beige garden level room looking out on a stub of street--occasionally cars passed by but the atmosphere in the room, for those inside, was one of serenity and removal. Martha sat through the aura cleansing even as her raged with pain. That pain seemed to somehow invade her stomach, making her feel sick inside.

Afterwards, the only person that she really knew who attended these sessions, came up to her and asked her about "her plan."

"I'm leaving in two weeks," Martha replied.

"So soon?" said the person.

"Does it seem soon? Funny I feel like I've prepared for it for a while."

"How is your husband taking it?"

"He seems fine with it."

"I heard a story about Ruston a few days ago, incidentally. They talked about all of the refugees moving there."

"Refugees?"

"Yeah, that was the word they used..."

Martha took the word inside and didn't really make much of it. Was she a refugee? She hadn't thought of it that way before. Because of that, the idea fell away from the central force of the idea, the "plan" as it had been called. In two weeks, she would move to a small town called Ruston, West Virginia, to the radio quiet zone.

***

When she gave her notice at work, Martha didn't go into details. Rather she went into details but none of the pertinent ones. No, in fact, she gave completely fabricated details, convincing details, but details with no substance to them. Had Martha been a different person and in a different state of mind, the "details" she gave might have been called a delusion. She told her boss that her husband accepted a job in West Virginia--it was a good opportunity--it couldn't be passed up--she felt compelled to move--and so on. Meanwhile Greg was probably at home peeling potatoes for dinner or simply sitting.

But the details made a compelling case for the urgency behind her request to resign. Really her boss was relieved, Martha had only been an adequate worker anyone--rarely showing much ambition or drive. She had not advanced beyond being an advanced administrative assistant in the engineering college's offices. She always seemed to be ducking out for doctor's appointments, and recently seemed very antagonistic towards the young graduate students and researchers--particularly anyone who dealt with anything involving waves or radiation.

Martha's mother had been a hippy, but now was a dead hippy, which was more or less fine for Martha. The stories her mother told about living day to day and not caring about the material world while they scrambled to get rent payments together had not conveyed the intended message to her daughter. But now, Martha found herself trying to recount and reimagine some of those stories. She marveled, in fact, that she was quitting her job, leaving her husband and moving somewhere with no job, no steady place to live, and no real sense of the path.

The path outlined by the plan only led as far as the lodging house in Ruston. Beyond that there simply was no plan. Martha's sense of wonder about this reminded her of her mother, but almost as a visitation or haunting does, only Martha felt the haunting on the inside. A part of her mother had surfaced inside her when she had least expected it.

Had she asked, Greg probably could have outlined other similarities between Martha and the woman he had known briefly as his mother-in-law. But he never bothered to do so; and she had never bothered to ask.


## WAKING UP IN METAL

The echo of her own snores still startled her in the morning sometimes. The cot she slept on creaked, and sometimes, in throws of a nightmare, she would lash out and begin banging of the metal lined walls of the chamber were she was forced to sleep now. But when the banging stopped and she became lucid again Deana could only the hear muffled and still quiet around her. Then a dog would bark--maybe from next door or maybe a few block away. She might hear the faint sounds of a car passing by. The quiet came back and she would fall asleep again.

Sleeping in the chamber took getting used to. She couldn't afford to have anything large or elaborate built. A neighbor came over in the evenings for a few weeks and framed the 8 x 9 structure and covered it with layers of metal and chicken wire. The whole thing was built around a simple subfloor covered with multicolored scraps of carpet that the found from an abandoned housing development on the other side of town.

Once she moved her bed into the chamber and made the bed up with sheet edged in plaid and worn down comforter, the muffled and metallic space felt a little more inviting. She added a few more comforts--a picture, a small side table with a lamp. Soon she had to abandon the lamp as the buzz of current--and the long extension cord running from the house--began to bother her too. She purchased a head lamp from the army surplus store and read before bed with a beam of light extending from her forehead.

The chamber also reminded Deana of her father. He had spent several years attempting to build an elaborate bomb shelter when she was a little girl. He would sometimes come home from work and scarcely could be dragged away from his digging or sawing to help with homework or read a bed time shelter. Then the obsession just dissipated, leaving a rickety staircase to a soggy half-finished bomb shelter in the back of their yard. Years later when her father died, her older brother, Teddy, paid some day laborers $100 to strip the thing for scrap and fill the rest in with dirt. 

She remembered watching from the kitchen as the men--two Mexican migrant workers--greeted a friend who arrived that morning in a deformed pickup with tall wooden planks affixed to each side of the bed, nod grimly to one another then get to work. Within an hour, the man in the salvage truck was bouncing back through the yard to the alley and the two other men began shoveling dirt into the hole.

Whenever she thought of the shelter, she resented her brother and his aggressive handling of their father's legacy. He had dispatched, through his envoys, that part of their father's legacy, his personality, with a cold, bureaucratic logic--"It's a hazard and will make the place impossible to sell." Of course, the house never did sell and only in the last few years did Teddy reluctantly agree to deed the house to her.

Was the chamber built on the exact spot of the bomb shelter? She couldn't remember its exact location. The distance between the entrace and the back stairs of the porch had warped with time. It was both closer and farther away depending on the moment when she tried to recover that piece of information. Instead, she opted to have it built near the garage, under a tree, hoping to avoid needing to pull a permit for what, as her helpful neighbor explained was "little more than a shielded TuffShed."

***

Deana generally couldn't hold down jobs. She was cranky, irascible, unpersonable. Inclined to airing opinions about matters that had not, and probably would not, surface in any normal flow of conversation. She was unpleasant to be around and no one liked her much. The neighbor that helped her was probably just as odd, though Deana barely noticed the eccentricities of others. There was almost ethical quality to the way in which she accepted and dealt with the quirks of others.

Maybe her acceptance of the churlish behavior that so many people exhibit on a regular basis--their propensity to talk too much, be self-absorbed, and bound by fleeting notions of acceptable behavior--made her better in some way. Her tolerance was the very model of tolerance because the notion of tolerance hardly factored into it at all. The only flaw in this nearly flawless ethical system was that she expected the same suspension of reaction in other people as well. Unfortunately for, few people could restrain or not even experience a flutter of irritation in the face of someone endless stream of pronouncements and judgments.

So, Deana kept her expenses to a minimum. She didn't have to pay for housing now that she owned her parent's house (or what she always called her father's house, keeping the image of the bomb shelter squarely in focus as she did so). She worked odd jobs; she volunteering at what ever organizations could tolerate her; and she flirted with varying types of government help.

For several months, the chamber strained her resources and Deana felt that she was going to have to find some steady work. Fortunately for her, she found a few house cleaning jobs that went at least a little way towards covering the costs. And for a while, it was good. The chamber's layers of metal and mesh seemed to keep the waves out, to dampen the impact of the radiation that was all around her. All of the disadvantages of sleeping, basically living, in a tiny shed gave way to her renewed sense of good health. 

But a few months after that, the headaches and rashes returned. Her level of irritability became even too much for her neighbor to tolerate. He had come over to check on the chamber only to find her insulting the quality of the work he had done. She complained for 15 or 20 minutes about how drafty it was, how inadequate and poorly thought out the design was. Her neighbor turned around and walked off without saying a word, leaving Deana to shrug and get back to thinking over the chamber's inadequacies.

***

She knew that the pamphlet was somewhere in the house; she just couldn't remember where. After several months of merely passing through the house, she felt a bit disoriented to be inside of it again. The complexity of the floor, the strong angles of the doorways, the porousness of the windows all overwhelmed her. After a few minutes of hyperventilating in the living room, she remembered that she had stowed away the pamphlet in a dresser drawer in the guest bedroom--formerly for the guest that was her brother.

In the top drawer of that dresser, she found a gold and blue glossy pamphlet that read across the find "Wireless sickness is real...And I have the cure!" Deana had no quibble with the firs assertion of that statement; she felt more skeptical about the second. Dr. Nick Conroy's picture on the back flap did little to reassure him--a slightly cross-eyed and unsmiling man stared out at her wearing a plain shirt and tie. 

Inside, though, the pamphlet advertised a refugee from the epidemic known as "wireless sickness." The zig-zagging bulleted list of symptoms matched her own. And the photographs of the refuge being advertised seemed perfect to her. As much as she loved her father's home and the land and the memories of the bomb shelter. Deana knew that the promise held out by this pamphlet, the promise of a place called Ruston and community called "Salubrious", would sustain her in the present and future.


## SALUBRIOUS

The problem never was having an idea, a vision, and momentum. Dr. Conroy could beam from one inspiration to the next with little hesitation. But he rarely followed through and never completed anything. Really, there wasn't a thing in his life that he had completed. Of course, this didn't keep him from printing "Dr." or "MD" by his name. And he could have card and signs and posters and brochures printed by the hundreds and thousands. He was, in fact, very task oriented and often ruthlessly efficient at the small things. The boxes and piles of literature in his living room spoke eloquently to this point.

Dr. Conroy was a "doer" trapped in the wildly spun visions of a dreamer and thinker. The "do" parts of his personality didn't really merge until he his upon the idea of Salubrious. As with any account of truly inspired creation, though, that exact moment on inception was hard to pin down for him. But he did remember the time a year and a half ago when a defeated and worn out man came to his back-of-the-building office complaining about the waves.

The small city and the boxy office rooms in an old 1920s building with hollow sounding hallways were no where near an ocean, even a Great Lake. The place was soundly Midwestern and had the hulks of old mills and factories to prove it. Dr. Conroy poised his fingertips under his chin for a few moments before responding, "Of course, from the cell phone towers." The man's response demonstrated revealed immediately to Dr. Conroy his genius as a diagnostician.

They spent an hour or so talking over the etiology of these symptoms. Both the man and Dr. Conroy were convinced that they were witnesses the emergence of a new disease. Had Dr. Conroy referred to the Biblical language of former years, he might have said of a new plague or a scourge, or even a visitation, why not? It was clear to him though that this man was being assaulted by the modern world. In such a world as this one, full of screens and people looking deeply into those screens, mindless of the cell degrading nature of the wave energy passing through them daily, who would step forth to protect a man like this.

After that man left, Dr. Conroy considered him for several minutes. The man, whose name was recorded in tidy chart, was not remarkable in any particular way. Did not exhibit the acute nervous sensitivities that he had read about in the classic cases of neurotics in Dr. Freud's time. No, this man might very well have been a plain American factory worker, a blue collar hero of sorts. Dr. Conroy quickly rewrote that last part--an earnest working man--who suffered from a mysterious illness.

It hardly bears stating that Dr. Conroy's regarded his professional status very highly. He regarded himself as a fine, if misunderstood, medical mind. Of course, that mind had bent its inborn powers to religion (as mentioned), to feats of invention and engineering, to marketing and sales, and to a host of other occupations. Yet it was precisely to not be occupied that seemed to motivate many of these feats of genius. Maybe it was more correct to say that people like you or I would be likely to not appreciate the channels into which the doctor's exertions ran.

There was, in fact, a kind of metaphysical genius to his labor and his effort. But from nothing sprang something and the doctor was able to rent an office and afford regular trips to the regional casinos. He was well dressed--not ostentatious or absurd--but he realized the value of presenting himself professionally. Attending to details often earned him the implicit trust of patients who watched for signals like freshly pressed clothes, polished shoes, and yet were hardly aware of doing so.

***

A few weeks after the man visited his office, Dr. Conroy stumbled into a series of facts that set his idea for Salubrious in motion. It started with a conversation he overheard in the coffee shop near his office. Two men were talking about aliens. The conversation verged into tin foil conspiracies--which even the doctor hadn't peddle at any point his career..yet. They referred several times to the Quiet Zone and the radio telescope housed there. One of the men wearing an orange trucker hat was point across the street trying to indicate how large the telescope was. Whether it was the notion of a quiet zone or the image of a enormous dish pointed at outer space, the doctor was preoccupied by an image of the telescope for much of the day. 

The doctor often scanned real estate listings on the Internet. He felt that it was a good idea to always have a back up plan and exit strategy, just in case some one came looking for him. He had never been east for an extended period of time, and found himself looking at places in West Virginia and reading about the area. Then he circled back to a reference to the telescope and the Radio Quiet zone. Then on the screen was a listing for an old farm house just outside a place called Ruston. It seemed perfect for something, even though he didn't know what yet.

The man who visited his office, a listing for a farm, two men talking space and telescopes in a coffee shop--these were the ingredients that combined together in his mind and set off a series of images, little fragments of narratives--almost small movies playing out then fading out in his mind, and phrases, slogans, whole speeches that came to him. Suddenly the word "salubrious" came to mind. He walked over to a book shelf in his office where, next to a DSM, he had an old red dictionary. He looked the word up: favorable to or promoting health or well-being.


## FINDING SALUBRIOUS

A phone call in the middle of the night woke Dr. Conroy up. He answered and learned that he was being evicted from the building that housed his office, which housed him as well most of the time. His landlord was really more of a sub-contractor, if such a thing exists, of some owner who had long since moved to Palm Beach and may have been dead. But the building was being "condemned" and torn down for construction. For most of us, this kind of news would likely rattle us out of our plans. Days might go fueled by anxiety and despair. Dr. Conroy accepted these kinds of "adjustments" as a matter of course. 

Given his current proximity to the office, he got up from the couch, brushed his teeth, drank from a half-finished cup of coffee sitting near by and proceeded to erase himself from the place. Within an hour or so, he had everything important packed up. The sun has barely risen before Dr. Conroy had left town, never to return.

He had no obvious destination in mind, no plan to mention. He knew that forces would lead him to West Virginia, eventually. Strangely, he didn't feel compelled to rush there. The farm that he had seen would clearly still be around. The name "Salubrious" still occupied his mind and set off the little vignettes that he had imagined the night before. He saw himself leaning on a porch railing before a field of folk. He  had imagined a procession in the street--at time a body was being escorted in a hearse, as if West Virginia had been transformed in to the tenements of 19th century New York. Most of all, he saw himself looking up as a table full of people bent their heads to pray, muttering the words that he spoke, the very words that he mouthed he saw them mouthing too.

These kinds of scenes, of visions, were what kept Dr. Conroy moving and searching. He did not believe that these fragments of stories were already planted out there in the world for him to find. Despite his strong leaning in the direction of esoteric thought and mysticism, he leaning even more strongly on the notion that he could will these scenes into existence. Only on a few occasions had be felt to moment when his conscious mind became aware that it was acting out one of these stories, as if put on call that the script was being played out. Rather than diminish his sense of power, however, these rare moments thrilled him and kept him going.

***

Immediately, though, he decided to pay his recent patient a visit. The man was laid up at home on a workman's comp claim. Somehow the man had been able to connect his disease to workplace conditions. As a result, he was able to sit in silence in his house trying to ward off the waves as best as he could. Dr. Conroy figured that he would call on the man before leaving town and plant seeds to sow at some future point in time.

The man had been remarkably receptive to the idea that microwaves or radiation waves (Dr. Conroy would have to sort out the details later) were causing his feelings of nausea, headaches, and general fatigue. Whether or not the man had come in with this conclusion already formed or was highly suggestive remained to be seen. Dr. Conroy, of course, intended to see right now.

The door opened to a sliver of a dark, gloomy room in a boarding house. The house wasn't very large and contained an even smaller room for the man. The room was more like a room and a half with a small sink and a toilet in what might have been a closet at some point. The man currently had his clothes hanging from a heavy metal pipe that cut the room diagonally into two triangles. As the doctor entered, he wasn't really surprised by what he saw. The room was spare and tidy. There were five or six wine bottles in the window sills--that was the only real evidence of clutter. Some people may have been shocked or disturbed by the room's general state of disrepair, but the doctor had lived among enough creaking floors, broken tiles, and peeling paint to hardly notice that.

Instead, the doctor did feel somewhat put off by the complete lack of personality in the room--no pictures, no art, no clippings pinned to the wall. While didn't think of things in these exact terms, the doctor's feeling might have been summed up as follows: People with no interests and personalties make terrible marks. With no foothold and nothing to bargain with (speaking emotionally, or at least mentally), how could you negotiate with a person like this?

At first it seemed that the man would let the doctor in, but after cracking the door, he waved the doctor in and shut it quickly, saying, "I feel better with it closed." It took the doctor a few beats to realize that the man meant "better" in the physical and not emotional sense. The man set in the chair in front of the simply wooden desk and pointed the doctor to the bed. The doctor sat down on the bed, letting the man know through his body language that he was studying the room. There was nothing wrong in letter people like this see or understand something of the process. Sometimes trying to hide your curiosity caused more problems than not.

The man had tin foil pressed into the corner of the room. Scraps of metal seemed to by glued into this spot and that. The man rubbed at his left arm. It was then that the doctor noticed the missing tip from the man's index finger. The digits terminated in a rounded, bony knob instead of the graceful arc of a finger tip. Dirty, overly long finger nails capped the other fingers.

"I used to be a computer programmer," the main said suddenly, bending slightly to catch the doctor's eyes. "Now I feel that they are programming me!" He turned back to the desk reaching for a half smoked cigarette. "I'm going to smoke this." The doctor nodded.

"In California, I had a wife and a kid and wrote code--assembly language for farm equipment and factory equipment. Real machines--machines that did things. Not beaming things back and forth, telling people where you are at all times. I mean, do you know where you are at all times?"

The doctor was a flexible man--some might say flexible to a fault, flexing himself out of existence from time to time. But he was a man who was used to having a presence in a room. As this man who say across from him writhed in his chair and took long drags from the cigarette perched at the bony ends of his finger, the doctor felt his presence somewhat diminished. Rather, it might be more appropriate to say that that presence, that thing that could almost exist independently of himself had not decided how to manifest itself in the room, like a uncertain spirit being channeled by a mumbling medium.

After a pause, "I almost killed my wife...you're not a cop." That wasn't a question. "I almost killed her with a car in a park by our house. I almost ran her down while she was walking. I don't know why." 

"What do you do now?" the doctor asked. They hadn't covered these mundane matters before.

"Work in a computer repair store outside of town. I take the bus there." He paused again. "You know, there are powerful forces at work here, controlling people. It's a nexus point for a lot of disturbing stuff. I can feel it all around me. I want to get out of here."

"Why don't you leave?"

He laughed, "Yeah..."

"Look," the doctor said, leaning in from the sagging bed where he sat. "I've got this farm in West Virginia...been there?" The man shook his head--it was always a good idea to check. "I've got this farm and I'm looking for people to join me. People that have your condition."

"You think there are others?"

"I do..." The doctor tried to assess how far to go with this one. He was tattered and shattered and very rough, but maybe he could be honed into something useful. The Neanderthals took days and days to forge their tools. The doctor was a patient man too.

"Give me your wallet," the man said. "I'm not going to steal it, what do I look like?" Well, that was the question, wasn't it. "Give it to me. I'll read your soul." The doctor, as a bit of a showman himself, couldn't resist a come on like that. He handed a slim grey leather wallet to the man. He rotated it over the bony stub of the finger. Then he pressed it to his cheek. "You have seen this, done things. You're ambitious, but worldly. This..." he waved his free hand over the doctor, "is vanity. You have to let go of your vanity. You've got too much of the world on you. You're afraid to really let it go and really see."

The doctor didn't react--at least not knowingly, at least. "Like you?"

"Ha, ha! Like me!? Well, I see things as they are."

"Then why did you come to me for help?" 

"Because I'm dying and a dying man needs a doctor."

The doctor took  his wallet and replaced it in his back pocket. He ended this interesting visit by telling the man about Salubrious, gave him the address, the pitch. "I'm heading out there soon." The man nodded.

As he left, the doctor felt very inspired by this meeting. An imaginative man like the doctor needed his imagination to be fired once and a while. The man with the stub for a finger certainly did that. Most people, you or I, for instance, probably would have counted the money in their wallet or checked to see that an ID or a credit card was still there. But it never occurred to the doctor to check. He knew the difference between petty thieves and inspired criminals. This man's madness probably needed poetry to express its true sound and form.


## THE FIRST REFUGEE

His money had come to his second or third hand through the winding branches of the family tree. He had inherited a steady flow of dividends from savvy investments in oil companies and chemical companies in the early 20th century by a great uncle. He was one of several "heirs" who now benefited from the thrift and frugality of this great uncle (or so the story went). Whether it was rot in the roots or instability in the branches, the money that flowed from their ancestor hardly bound the recipients together into something called a family. Anthony Charles, in other words, was not a family man.

He had lived with his mother in Palm Beach for many years, biding his time until her death. When she finally did pass on, he stayed in the desert town golfing and gambling and passing time. This life of leisure did not protect him from an overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with his health. He had consulted with doctors in several states. He had even visited specialists who helped with people with exotic ailments when they traveled to even more exotic destinations. He had been in and out of hospitals in Thailand, in the Philippines, in South America.

There was something in the air, he felt, the same air that he sliced and wedged his golf balls through that he responded to poorly. There was something strange, though, that took place in the bars of country clubs like the ones he visited. There was a kind of threshold for paranoid talking. Anthony was very aware of this threshold and never really voiced his opinion loudly. His acquaintances often remarked though that he didn't carry a cell phone--he was always looking for pay phones. The waitresses at the Palm House--his base of operations, so to speak--often let him use the office phone or even their own calls to call his mother (when that was still an issue) or to place bets.

People noticed that he didn't carry a cell phone, rarely was seen around computers, and even seemed a bit uneasy around televisions. "I'm not a technophobe," he would argue. Maybe he wasn't. But he didn't invite the stuff in either.

Over the last few years, the uneasiness turned to physical symptoms--redness, headaches, occasional vomiting. Once he came to his knees in the middle of a gold tournament and lost $5000 dollars because of it. He started to avoid flying and traveling. His social impulses, of course, kept him from becoming an utter recluse, but he was on the verge by most standards.

It was around this time that he started to hear about people buying up land in Colorado and then in Montana. He read a profile of a well-to-do banker from the Midwest relocating much of his operations to a ranch outside of an old farming community in the West. This seemed appealing to Anthony. Maybe he could buy up some land somewhere, put an embargo on wires and waves and signals zipping around all over the place. It didn't take long to imagine these places becoming much like the place where he was now--an oasis suddenly overrun by oasis seekers.

While his sense of what the rich and privileged were did not amount to class consciousness, he knew what people with money were capable of, what they would do to a place. Already Palm Springs was overrun by coffee shops and restaurants set up to look like laboratories. You could hardly get a decent meal anymore, he might have complained, had he been a crank and social outcast.

***

It was during this time, during a golf trip to Arizona (he drove there, of course), that he struck up a conversation with an astronomer who worked at Arizona State. They talked college sports in an uneven way, Anthony hardly invested in any particular team or even in the concept of college sports; the astronomer approached the subject with academic aloofness mixed with a defensiveness about his institution compared to other ones. In any event, they began discussing the Radio Quiet zone in West Virginia and the space telescope there.

"They just said, 'No transmissions here.' I don't know if they could do it again," the astronomer said. "I mean, can you imagine some of these guys in Washington saying to the telecom lobbyists at their daughter's engagement party, 'Hey, you can't broadcast in an area with size of two eastern states. Nothing, to any one, no questions asked.?' It wouldn't happen."

"But they did do it."

"Sure, in the 1950s. The government could do anything then. and they did."

"So, what does the quiet zone mean?"

"No interference from telecommunications, from broadcast signals. The mountains do most of the work; the law does the rest."

Anthony decided after this conversation that he would buy a nice piece of property in this quiet zone and retire there. Not only could he probably get a very nice deal on land, but maybe this strange condition that he had been feeling would disappear.

***

His business in Palm Springs wrapped up with little ado. There weren't people to discard as he left town. Had Anthony been a different person, and lived his live differently up until now, the lack of pull that Palm Springs exerted over him might have bother him. But, he left town in his packed car, packet only with a few suit cases, his golf clubs, and an antique rifle that he owned (and why he owned it would take some time to explain), and proceeded to drive across the county to the Quiet Zone.

He didn't realize at the time that he was the first refugee. He didn't know that he would be on of many who would relocate to this square swath of land where waves and transmissions of all kinds had been exempted. At first, he wasn't even sure if his idea was sound. He spent several night sitting on the front porch of the farm house he bought, looking up at the pin pricks of starts in the sky. He didn't feel any different, the quiet here didn't have a tangibly different quality. Anthony felt cheated and slightly disappointed.

Perhaps he didn't realize or wasn't aware that he was looking for an experience, that what he had really craved was the feeling of something tangibly different. But what could this difference be? He was relocated to a spot of the earth that was regulated to keep things out and away, to push back at all of the tangible intangible signals of the modern world. It would be unfair at this point to lay the charge at Anthony's feet that he lacked introspection and self-awareness to realize this. He was, after all, trying to replace one set of sensations with what he perceived to be a different set of sensations and a feeling of peace.

The people in the nearby town also didn't respond as he had expected. His presence in town hardly was noticed. The old farmers and miners that passed through merely nodded at him. Maybe a child would point to his now outlandishly nice car, but even that didn't seem to merit any comment from anyone. Even when his newness was a topic of conversation, such a conversation would generally go something like this:

"You aren't Martha's son are you?" the woman checking him out at the grocery asked. She was an older, heavy set woman with tinted glasses on. She seemed to ask the question in a friendly, good natured way.

"No mam, I'm not." For some reason a Southern politeness was already creeping into his speech; he wasn't sure why. 

The woman passed a few more cans across the scanner. "Well, then, who are you?"

The question took him aback. She wasn't staring at him, or even giving him much notice now. "I'm new in town. I live in the old Palmer house."

"Oh, that's right, P.J. mentioned that he was sold that house...under unusual circumstances. I bet you're a scientist or someone working on that telescope." he didn't respond immediately, leaving an opening for her to say, "Well, that's okay. I know you folks can't say much about your work, listening to aliens and the like. Well, we appreciate the work you do to keep the aliens away."

Over the course of several weeks, word spread that he was an alien specialist working at the lab. One day a little boy rode up the long rutted road up to his house on a bicycle. 

Anthony had mowed down a swatch of pasture for use as a driving range green. The grass was craggy and the ground uneven, but he found himself out on the range every day. His body seemed to want to reflexively go through the motions it knew and was accustomed to. Sometimes he felt like he hardly controlled it at all. When the boy walked up besides him, he was mid-swing. The boy started him; he turned back to the boy, who winced at the club that was raised in a striking position.

"No, no, it's okay. Who are you? Do your mom and day know that  you are here?" Anthony had seen enough serial killer and most wanted shows to know that a situation like this could end up very badly for him.

"My telescope is broke."

"I'm sorry to hear that."

"It got busted when my little brother tried to swing at a tree with it. He thought it was a bat. I need it for my science fair project. I'm tracking a star."

He handed the telescope to Anthony. The lenses were cracked, the telescope didn't retract any more. It was broken beyond repair. Even if he had been some kind of mechanical, engineering prodigy, he only had a wobbly hammer and a few mis matched screwdriver left in the garage by the previous owner.

"You want me to fix this? I don't think I can."

Strangely, the boy didn't look disappointed. "My mom said that you work with the telescope."

"Oh, no, no. I don't do that. I'm not sure why she thinks that, but I don't work with the telescopes at all. I don't know..."

"So, you're not one of the telescope guys?"

"No, I'm not."

The boy turned back to retrieve his bike and return to town. As he walked down the road, the boy seemed like an emissary to his people, an emissary to deliver the news that this man was not the telescope man. And if that was the case, what kind of man was he?


## IN THE AIRPORT

Greg had little to say the last night of his dinner duty. Martha's last day at work was two days earlier. She had been preoccupied with her preparations to leave--oil changes, grocery shopping, and trips to the Salvation Army. She was only taking a backpack of clothes with her to start her new life. Greg still didn't know exactly where she would be living, who she would be living with. In fact, he didn't ask her any question. Following along with the theme of his acceptance of her condition, he didn't comment on this uncertainty either.

With the dinner dishes clean, Greg carried her bag down the car and waited for Martha. She gathered up her purse and scooped up some change on the dresser, and a compact that she had overlooked. The house phone rang then, and rang and rang. She decided not to answer and moved to door. But the phone kept asking for her and she found herself moving towards it to answer its call.

"Martha, are you there?" It was her mother.

"Yes, Mom, it's me." She could barely hear her mother. The phone reception was poor and her mother sounded as if she was in a wind tunnel. "Mom, I said its me."

"I heard you! I'm trying to decide what to say to you right now."

"About what?"

"My god, Martha, about what? You sound crazier than I ever did." This was a whole new angle of attack from her mother. A completely new front had been opened up in their on and off again conflict. 

"Well, that's something, I guess, mother."

"When are you leaving?"

"Right now, mom. Greg is in the car waiting for me."

"He's doing what!?"

"Waiting for me..."

"I heard you! I heard you. I can hear you just fine. Why are you doing this?"

"Mom, I don't want to get into it right now."

"Well, where it sounds like you're going, now might be the only time. There's no phones, there? No radio? No television?"

"Well, there's some of that stuff. Why do you care? I thought you threw your hands up at that stuff."

"What if somethign happens to you?"

"I'll go to the doctor."

"Where are you living?"

"I don't know yet. Somewhere. I've heard that there is a place there, a refuge."

"A compound. Jim Jones, honey. That's all I have to say."

"Mom, I really have to do. Greg is waiting."

"That's the least of his worries right now."

"It will be fine mom. I just...I just need to do this."

"Okay, okay. I'm not going to step on this. Just stop and think ever now and again. I wish someone had told me that from time to time."

Downstairs, Greg was indeed waiting. He wasn't riled up or angry or seething. He seemed to just...exist in that car, hands on the wheel, listening to NPR. He automatically turned off the radio when she got near the car. It had always agitated her, and now would send her over the edge if he tried to leave it on.  They would be together in the car for over 30 minutes together. The time didn't bother Martha. She had cultivated remarkable skills of endurance. In fact they both were practically athletic in their capacity to endure one another.

As they crossed out of their town and into the town neighboring theirs, Greg suddenly said, "I'm going to be fine."

Martha wasn't sure what kind of response he wanted. Her confrontations with him often centered around his his riddle like requests for engagement from her. Was she supposed to affirm this? Deny it? What did he want? Martha did not know. We can at least take some comfort in the fact that she stopped to process her his comment and her response. Things weren't as bad as that.

"I'm  going to be fine. I'm not sure about you."

"I don't know what you're talking about." 

"I'm worried about you, Martha. I wish you weren't going, but I'm not going to stop you."

"Well, it's too late now." Those few words struck the chords of panic inside her. She felt confined in the car, suddenly aware of how heavy and impenetrable the dark outside the car window was. She went quiet and was buoyed up by car going up the on ramp and being flooded with light. This helped her somewhat, but she was aware of how radical and absolute this change was. And what about Greg? Would he be fine? She was just leaving him behind. What would he do? Would he start calling that woman Brenda? Or talking more to their neighbor Janelle? Maybe Holly would start calling again. 

Had there ever been a Brenda, a Janelle, or a Holly can't be confirmed, but these fear took over Martha for a moment. And for her, who would replace Greg? She had not posed this question to herself before now. Who would be in her life? What would her life be without another person? Another voice, a different perspective, intruded in the conversation at this point. This voice was the one compelling her on, making forceful arguments about the life and death situation that she was in. Somethings we do for reasons beyond things like love for other people. She had to survive because the world was killing her. Who has time to worry about boyfriends and partners when they are trying to survive an apocalypse.

***

As cars are wont to do, it arrived at the airport. Martha left Greg behind to take the car back. He had been instructed to sell it as soon as he could. Maybe he would, maybe he wouldn't. Martha consoled herself by thinking that maybe this was a parting gift--an old yellow hatchback. Yes, that would sustain him as he crawled out of the ruins of their relationship.

In the mood to dwell on last things, Martha also realized that this might be the last time she ever flew on a plane. She knew that the experience would be exhausting and probably profoundly traumatic. The last time she flew had been to a professional development conference in Atalanta. RAther than attend the conference, she had sat in her hotel room, in the bathtub half full of tepid water, which she repeatedly drained and warmed up, trying to keep herself from throwing up. Her boss had not been happy to learn later that no one saw her at the conference. Her alibi, such as he was, was a an older coworker who flirted with her from time to time, but he finally let it slip--it's hard to propel silly lies when the emotional force to fuel them is absent.

That had been her most recent trip on an airplane, and surely she could expect the same. As she imagined how sickened she would become, she sat down with her back at her feet on a long vinyl bench opposite the ticket counter. She lay down on the bench, only to find herself being awoken by a woman in a subtly striped blue shirt and a swagged blue and red checked neck scarf. As Martha sat up, she say a police office standing firmly in the background, passively alert to her movements.

"Mam, are you okay? You fainted. Is this your bag?"

"Oh, yeah, it is."

"Okay, someone found this bag in the men's restroom."

"Really?" For some reason, she was feeling really groggy and found it hard to concentrate on the woman standing over her. She traced the lines of bleached hair to dark and gray roots peering out along the part of her hair, then was distracted again by the police officer. She started watching an Indian family waiting in line with an abundance of bags to check, all of them strapped and taped shut.

"Mam, are you traveling with someone?"

"No, I'm alone."

"Okay, I have a police officer here, he can help you if you need to file a report."

"Was anything stolen?" Now the panic was setting in.

"I don't think so. Why don't you check." Martha didn't notice the woman wave away the police officer, who was hanging back even further now. The officer began chatting with another police officer who was zipping by on a Segue. They both looked over at Martha, again without her noticing, but turned away, probably discussing a television show, a football game, or their kids.

With the woman's help, Martha confirmed that nothing was taken. They also checked for anything suspicious, but nothing seemed problematic or dangerous.

"I'm really sorry, I just started to not feel well and had to lie down."

The woman's empty, friendly look did not flinch in the face of this comment. She remained strictly professional. "Well, I'm just glad you're okay. Why don't you come with me, we'll get you checked in and to your gate. I can call a car."

"I won't need that. That's okay. Just help me get checked in."

"Okay, come with me."

Martha finally arrived at her gate, a little wobbly, but more coherent than before. She sipped on a bottle of water and ate bites of an overpriced bagel. The agents at the gate began announcing groups to board. Martha hung back from the massed crowd of aggressive traveler, all kicking their bags in front of them, inching closer and closer to the gates. As she boarded, people were already covering their eyes with sleeping masks, preparing their movies to watch, or just crumpled up with whatever paperback or magazine they brought to pass the time away.

She finally found her seat and got her carry-on bag stowed away. The plan pushed back from the gate and lumbered to the runway. When the jet engines finally roared to life and propelled the plane in the sky, she fell asleep for the duration of the flight.


## ON THE ROAD

This wasn't the first time that Dr. Conroy had slept in his car. It was, however, that persistent tapping at the window woke him up. The temperatures must have dropped over night and left his windows foggy and beaded with dew. As he became more conscious of his surroundings and the situation, he sat for a moment to seriously consider whether or not to roll down the window. He was tucked into the back seat of the car with a pile of blankets on top of him--not exactly mobile. Would he be able to dart into the front seat and get away?

He always left his keys in his pocket for his express purpose, only now, he couldn't find him. He felt around him quickly and had no luck.  His hand passed along the floor board beneath him and still no luck. The knocking on the glass became more persistent as he looked for his keys. Maybe he wouldn't be getting away so easily.

"Doctor? Doctor?" The knock spoke.

He recognized the voice immediately. It was the man, his patient, this patient named Henry, whom Dr. Conroy wanted to call "Patient X," but even he wasn't that grandiose, yet. Tossing the blankets back, the doctor sat up and rolled down the window. 

"I thought you might have already left. But I saw your car as I was on the bus."

"What are you doing here Henry?"

"I'm coming with you to Salubrious. I've decided. I'm sick of feeling this way. You're the only doctor that is going to heal me."

The doctor, Henry's doctor--as he was just called--had not planned to take any followers along with him. He wasn't performing some kind of Mormon flight with a band of outsiders and visionaries. The doctor had wanted to assess the places the in queit zone first, get a feel for the people, then begin making his move. Bringing Henry along would complicate things. He rubbed his eyes a few more times and opened the door to stretch.

"You didn't make it far," Henry said. He was lighting a cigarette now and bouncing at the knees.

"No, I wasn't in a rush."

"Where are you going exactly?'

"Well, let's just say I have a spot in mind."

"The spot must not be going anywhere then."

"No, I guess it's not."

"The store's opening."

"Huh?"

Henry pointed across the parking lot of the Walmart. "The store is opening." The doctor noticed an old man spraying down the expanse of glass doors at the entrance of the store. A truck was pulling away from the loading docks at bag and squealed loudly as the air brakes released their pressure. Nearby a man in a flannel shirt emerged from a small popup RV trailer and began crossing the parking lot to the store.

"Come on," Henry said. "Let's get some coffee."

"Oh, okay." The doctor still wasn't entirely used to the relative feeling of helplessness that he felt around Henry. Perhaps helplessness isn't the right word, he felt a kind of distance or remove, and was willing to be swept along as an impartial observer of event does. This man, Henry, seemed to have his own unique ebb that pulled the doctor along. Perhaps it was a relief to someone like the doctor to not continually assert his will over someone. Or maybe the long view was that his passivity was exertion of will. The particulars of this fine point would remain to be seen for some time.

They entered the store just as the last clicks of the locks were sounded. Except for occasionally taking up residence in a big box store parking lot, Dr. Conroy rarely entered these kinds of places. He was always impressed by how full they seemed, and yet impermanent at the same time. He was always surprised, for instance, to look up and see just how unfinished the massive ceiling was and how it looked like there was only a thin sheet of metal covering all of that merchandise.

An immediately flaw in their plan was apparent as soon as they realized that no coffee had been made, rather it was puffing and blowing its way into existence in the small food area tucked off to the side of the store. That meant that they would have to walk around for a while.

"I'm hungry," Henry said. "Let's go find the donuts."

Conveniently, the rows of boxed donuts were placed very close to the front of the store and offered an array of choices. The doctor picked up a package of coconut flake donuts. Henry picket up two packets of white powdered donuts. He quickly opened one and began pacing through the next few aisles and popping little snowy donuts in his mouth. An unusual feeling of panic and caution came over the doctor. Would someone notice that this strange muttering, bouncing man was eating little baby donuts without paying for them?

Normally, this kind of thing would not bother him at all. He felt much more visible and exposed around this man and  didn't like that feeling at all. This feel naturally set of an ongoing, spring loaded process of intensely trying to hide his guilt and worrying about it being revealed. He worried that would draw even more attention to himself and acted all the more unnaturally too.

His concern was not completely baseless. For some reason that were numerous people milling around the Wal-Mart this early in the morning. All of them in various states of dress--a woman dressed but not made up for work, an old woman whose house dress was passable as everyday wear. There was a family all wearing denim vests with eagles emblazoned on them. These people, and the workers populating the store at that time, were hardly aware or concerned about this doctor and his strange companion.

That was until Henry alighted on Tammy, or so he called her. She was standing in a aisle of hairspray and makeups whose luminosity at that hour of the morning made them seem positively neon. The doctor was a few feet behind him, a few consciously and cautiously planned paces, when he heard Henry saying, "Tammy, Tammy, you didn't call me."

As the doctor turned the corner, he saw Henry propped against the shelving talking, or trying to talk, to a girl. She couldn't have been more than 17 or 18 years old, and the doctor hoped the later. "Henry, what's going on?" he asked.

"Who's that?" this girl asked. She seemed like a nice enough girl but had the some kind of look of wildness to her that Henry did. Something inside of her seemed to move too quickly, too be too full of life, as if the wrong part of her had been wound up and animated when she was set in motion. "Who is that?" she asked again.

"That's my doctor. He's looking after me." The doctor flinched when Henry said this, but thought he hid it well.

"Hey, we're going to West Virginia, leaving soon..." This was the first that the doctor had heard of it. "You should come. Come with us. I haven't forgot about our night together." The doctor realized that this situation could get bad very quickly.

"Henry," he said, "I really think we should get going. I'm sure that this girl's parents don't want her coming with us."

Then the thing inside of her went off, "I don't give a crap about them. I do what I want."

Henry was laughing, as if very pleased with the scene he was creating. He took a flask out of his coat pocket and began drinking. "Yes! Yes! You don't need them. Let's go, let's go now." They left the aisle and proceeded to the front of the store. Henry and this girl Tammy were hanging all over each other now, laughing loudly and stumbling across the waxy, bright store floors.

Just then Tammy's mother turned out of an aisle, "What the hell are you doing, Tammy? Get away from that pervert!" The doctor no longer had to worry about masking his paranoia. All eyes were on them.

Tammy's mother started yelling in the store, "This man is a god damn pervert and child molester. He raped my daughter!"

The doctor stepped forward, "I'm sorry there must be some misunderstanding." He tried putting his hand on her arm to calm her down. She shrugging him off violently.

"What, did you watch? Are you gonna rape me now too? Someone call the police, they're trying to abduct us."

The doctor stepped towards Henry and grabbed him, "You're coming with me. We're leaving now!"

Henry started laughing violently, fell down behind he doctor. Dr. Conroy, in a surge of energy, started pulling him on his back across the slick shiny floor. "Get up, get up, damn it," he hissed at Henry. With one energetic pull, he had Henry on his feet and running after him to the car. Behind them several employees chased them, their blue vests flapping madly like wings. A golf cart with a security guard whipped around from the side of the building and started pursuing them.

The only person that worked there who wasn't 18 and wasn't 80 was herding carts on an electric scooter of his own. The long train of carts wobbled and jerked even as the security guard approached in the golf cart. The cart shepard turned back and watched Dr. Conroy and Henry race across the parking lot. He tried to stop the carts from cutting of the security guard, but it was too late. The carts broke across the security guard's cart like a metallic wave and didn't give way.

Dr. Conroy and Henry were in the car and driving away. Dr. Conroy hesitated only at the turn off of the access road onto the sliver of highway that ran back to town. He wanted desperately to be free of his passenger. Their relationship was starting to feel more like a visitation to the doctor than anything else. Between skipping out on his office space and their recent encounter with Tammy--or Tammy's mother to be more precise--going back wasn't an option. So, he made that turn to Salubrious, to the quiet zone, though preoccupied mostly by how he could ditch this strange man named Henry.


## A MAN NAMED GREG MALONEY

"You must be Greg," the rail thin store manager at the Starbucks greeted him from behind the espresso machine. "Have a seat, I'll be with you in a minute." Greg silently took a seat by the window and scanned the faces in the coffee shop. From the outside this man named Greg Maloney seemed impossibly bored. You wouldn't think that there could be anything interesting going on inside of him. He normally had a sleepy look about him. His stubble always seem to resurface within an hour or so of  shaving. His eyes had a downturned, tear drop shape to them. And recently, he  hadn't bothered to keep up his clothes very well. All of this compounded by the fact that he rarely smiled these day.

He was dressed better today. He had even smiled a little at the bus driver and said hello to her. He wasn't sure why, but a feeling of indebtedness had come over him at that moment. Had he been in a talkative mood, Greg might have told you that he really was ruled by whims--at least small whims like this one. A feel like that could overwhelm him and seem right in the moment. In between though, it was sometimes hard to say what he felt--he certainly could always tell.

Behind the sleepy, bored look that he carried about with him, Greg was always watching and observing people. He was interested just now in two women sitting across from each other, separated by laptops. They both had large binders in their laps and gestured wildly over the computer screens as  they worked out whatever pitch or idea they were trying to flesh out. He was amazed by the intensity of their focus and connection with each other. They seemed more than alive, animated by their work. 

The problem with observations like this is that they sometimes turned back on him, making him hole up inside and recede from the feeling. The two women's/ energy and passion was interesting, yet off putting. They didn't' seem aware of how artificially amped up they were, how loud their voices were and how there was an old woman circling around looking for a seat. Greg didn't get up either, law of the jungle and that sort of thing. Their lack of self-awareness disturbed him; they seemed to be drowning in themselves.

But was his unsettled feeling also because the didn't' see  him? didn't reciprocate his interest and attention? Perhaps it was unrealistic for him to expect them to do this. He hardly seemed present at all. And if he did feel this, and it isn't certain that he did, it wasn't necessarily sexual either. So, maybe the two women were completely tuning out the notice that he game them, their training having been gained in a completely different arena.

The manager sat down, not noticing the old woman either, incidentally. He had a copy of a resume and a job application with him. "So, you're Greg."

Greg shook his head, "I am. I am."

"Impressive work history. Sales, training, the works. So, I have to ask, why do you want to work here?"

Wasn't the answer obvious? Well, maybe it wasn't. "Well, to be honest with you, I've been out of work for a while..." The manager nodded his head through that part. "And I'm looking for something to engage me. I'd like to meet new people, I think."

"Umm, hmm. Very good. So, would you say that you are committed to customer service?" The manager, for what it's worth, came across as being very sincere. He was clearly following this script, but did so in a good natured way. He was very upbeat, hunched forward in his chair, nearly putting his face in Greg's. The contrast between the two was striking.

"I would say that. I think that being aware of other's people needs is very important. Maybe the most important thing."

"I completely agree. We need someone to work the early morning shifts. I had someone who flaked on me when he decided to move back to California and live with his parents. Couldn't take it, I guess."

Greg wasn't sure what the his potential predecessor couldn't take, so he tentatively added, "I'm pretty tough, I guess."

***

Greg learned the next day that he got the job, which was good news. Now that Martha had left, he only had a month left in their apartment before life would start to unravel for him. Unemployment wasn't really an option now. His time had run out. He would start next Monday. He really was desperate to get out of the apartment but something kept him there. Maybe it was the same passivity that had let Martha walk right out of his life.

He didn't feel bitter towards her for leaving. He didn't blame her or bemoan his situation. He thought she was slightly unhinged, but he always felt there was a kind of directness and honesty about her obsessions with herbs, auras, and other metaphysical forces. She never imposed these things on him per se, though she wanted his emotional participation and involvement. He had always hoped that she could reconcile herself to his tacit acceptance, and embrace his slack claim over her as a kind of love, maybe even love itself.

There was a kind of ethical impulse to his love for her. We might think it admirable and imagine all of the ways that this world view or that one could argue for and justify it. Greg was a man who didn't want to grasp too tightly to the things of this world. He didn't always understand how being the one dangling from the slack rope being dangled by a sleepy eyed partner was a precarious position in its own right.

With the weekend over, Greg woke up early in the morning and drove to work. The car, an old white Toyota, clanged down the street. He parked behind the Starbucks where he would be opening, standing by the propped open back door, the manager was smoking a cigarette and sipping at coffee. "Hey, man, you made it."

"Yeah, pretty early."

"My wife works early too. Good thing I manage a coffee shop. Got any kids? I don't."

"No, no kids." Greg wasn't compelled to say anything about Martha. It might be years before he did.

"Say, do you know a girl named Martha?"

"Well, I do."

"Yeah, I thought so. My wife's friend said she knew a guy named Greg Maloney. They both went to school with Martha."

"I wouldn't know much about that. I've only lived here for a few years."

"Oh, yeah, where did you move from?"

"Colorado." That was as far as he would go.

"Great, place. I've been to Aspen a few times. Okay, let's get to work."

The Greg spent most of that day sweeping and watching. He saw the store manager pull countless shots and tried to follow the frantic tapping of fingers at the point of sale system. He left work with his finger tinted brown from the coffee and smelling like roasted beans.


## UNDOING THE METAL CHAMBER

As is often the case, a series of seemingly unconnected events set in motion other events that caused Deanna to leave her father's home behind. This wouldn't happen immediately, but the right set of events, fired in the order in which they did, in fact, fire caused this to happen. The first of these events was an unfortunate tagging incident. In the middle of the night, someone, most likely an angry child, Deana thought, had crept around her sleeping chamber and sprayed up one side of chamber. 

When she called the police, from inside the house of course, she verged on making it seem that either the entire chamber (which she basically called her house for the purposes of clarity) had been painted up from the foundation to the roof. She even slipped into making it sound like some clear ringing example fo hate speech and defamation has been left there. This wasn't the case, of course, and she managed to back down before things got really out of hand. Of course, they did get out of hand, just not at that moment.

The police dispatcher promised to send an office by and encouraged Deanna to file a report with the Streets and Sanitation department, "They'll remove the paint for you," the woman on the phone said, trying her best to be encouraging, but really wanting to get off of the phone as quickly as possible. 

"We'll see. I just have to deal with this right now. It's a real shame, and an insult. I can't believe it." It might have crossed the woman on the phone's mind that this line of reasoning was not completely valid, but she kept that opinion to herself, assuming she had, of course. 

Later that day, a police office did come by and looked at the chamber. He circled around with his flipped open notebook.

"This some kind of shed or greenhouse."

Deanna seemed very agitated by this question. "Sort of..."

"Which is it? I just need something for my report. It doesn't really matter what it is." The police office was nearing the end of his shift and wasn't inclined to ask about the weapons cache or torture chamber or whatever other demented thing this woman might have in there. It was better for him and his family at that moment that he choose not to be too particular about words and the things behind those words. "I'll call it a shed. It's shorter."

He circled back to the graffiti. "So, that's it?"

"Yes, they must have done it in the middle of the night."

"They? It was more than one person?"

"Well, I don't know. I'm just trying not to assume who it was. You know, I'm not trying to profile anyone."

"Sure, sure thing." His voice trailed off as he studied the graffiti. "It's not very well done," he said. Deanna seemed to step back and even seem deflated by the comment, as if an appraiser had devalued a seemingly rare and valuable possession. "Yeah, look, it really just saws 'heat' in reverse...tea-uh... Not sure what that means, but I'll write it down."

Deanna spent a few more minutes with the officer. She was trying to point out a problem in the foundation and how the two might be related. The police office figured that was unlikely, and really didn't want to get roped in to becoming this woman's subcontractor for the rest of the day. "That probably won't go in my report, you know, to keep it short. Otherwise, it's all in the report."

"What will happen now?"

"Now we wait and see if someone does something like this again. Fortunately for us we will have this report handy."

Deanna then leaped pass the officer and into the chamber, "Oh, and this," she said. She had [...]

It took Deanna several days before she decided to paint over the tagging. She had kept it up as some kind of reminder, but of what exactly, it's hard to say. But there were letters in sloppy dripping back paint, "teah" on the side of garage. She took a chip of paint from the chamber, literally having scrapped it off with a screwdriver, to the hardware store as a sample. The clerk behind the paint desk seemed skeptical about producing a good match. "We can try it." He was right, "we" did have to try. It took four employees, three clerks throwing up their hands in defeat, before the fourth one produced something that satisfied her.

She brought home her shopping back of roller pads and frames and brushes. For several hours, she worked coats of primer and paint over the tagging. With each layer the letters seemed to sear through less and less, until all that was left was an off white, yellowish block of paint where the tagging had been.

Deanna did some very part-time bookkeeping for an elderly couple who ran a liquor store. She entered transaction into the antiquated green and black computer system that they used, ran reports on a squealing dot matrix printer. The job kept her back in a small storeroom that functioned as an office, barricaded behind towers of wine and beer boxes. It was hard to tell who exactly was been whom out with the blockade of boxes, but the arrangement seemed to work for everyone involved.

At the end of the one of these shifts, the elderly couple usually handed her an envelope with $150 dollars and a bottle of wine, usually something that a sales rep had dropped off. Deana would usually binge on the wine that night, then not drink again until the next one. But as she was leaving that night, giving an update to the man who made up the elderly couple, she glanced out the window as saw her neighbor standing at opposite the store in the the shopping center parking lot. 

He was talking to a few kids who looked incredibly shifty and suspicious to Deanna. An idea seized her at that moment: her neighbor was responsible for the tagging. The truth of this assertion was so self-evident to her that learning that these boys were his nephews (which they weren't, but just to consider the possible) would not have swayed her conviction. 

It was entirely within her character to rush out of the store, wielding the wine bottle that the old man was handing her now, and smash her neighbor over the head with it. She very likely could have jumping upon him and bit him and scratched him, she was that furious. She didn't do anything of these things, but she could have. 

No, she kept nodding through the old man's story, shifting her focus from him to her neighbor. She could have sworn that she saw money passing between them. Maybe it was drug? Maybe both? She decided that she would find out.

That night, Deana bide her time until 9 pm or so. She put on a light jacket and walked a few houses down to her neighbor's house. Everything was dark, inside and outside, but she thought that she heard people moving inside. She went up to the house and knocked at the door. As she knocked, she realized that she had never been inside her neighbor's house. She really didn't know much about him. Well, that was about to change tonight.

No one answered her first knock, or the thirtieth. Perhaps whoever was inside underestimated her persistence, and perceptiveness. She saw the eyes peering out from the drawn blinds. She heard the creaks of feet creeping away from the door. Okay, the front door wouldn't work. Deana was going to go around to the back, only to realize that the fence surrounding the house didn't have a gate to the back. You might not be surprised to learn that Deana was not deterred. She decided to loop around the entire block and come down the back alley. At that point, she didn't find an opening from the back either. Now, she decided to scale the fence. At least she could do so from the back and not be seen by the neighbors who, naturally, had been studying her every movement on the porch. 

Once she alighted in the back yard, she noticed that a light was on in the cellar. She could see the tops of heads through the dirty, lit up pane. Deana crept along the side of the yard then climbed up on to the back porch from the side. Her foot landed on a board that wiggled and whined as she put her weight on it. She stopped for a moment then proceeded to the back door. She quietly opened the screen door and jiggled the door handle. it was incredibly wobbly, and there was no dead bolt on the back door. 

Deana put her shoulder firmly against the door, drew back and forced all of her weight against it. The old door gave way to her shoulder with little resistance. Once inside, Deanna could hear voices coming up from the basement door that was propped open with a large rusty hand weight. She picked up a large kitchen knife on the counter and proceeded down to the basement.

The stairs opened onto a series of faded murals that had been painted on the basement walls, the plaster on which they had been painted was chipping and falling off. The basement floor was covered in a golden yellow linoleum tiles that were covered in scuff marks. She turned to the left then turned through a doorway that had been framed by dark wood paneling.

Inside this interior room, her neighbor was sitting on a brown and golden wool couch, stuffing coming out in various places, with a bong. The kids that she had seen in the parking lot were sitting in overstuffed chairs and on the bean bags. An old woman, who Deana didn't recognize was sitting next to her neighbor. Next to her was a younger woman.

When he saw Deana, her neighbor got up. "Hey, hey! what are you doing here!?" What was she doing here? What was he doing, she wondered.

"I saw you in the parking lot today. I had to find out what you were doing."

"Well, doing this. Just relaxing, is that cool?"

Deana wasn't sure whether it was cool or not.

"Hey, is this your neighbor?" one of the kids asked. He was dressed in dark jeans and sweatshirt jacket emblazoned with a bright white skull. 

"Yeah, guys, this is Deana. She's cool, or can be, I guess."

The kid's friend, who was half asleep in the chair, looked up. "Oh, yeah, you tagged her garage."

"Shit man, you weren't supposed to say that. Ha, ha, well, what the hell? Yeah, I did it."

Deana was completely disoriented. The haze of pot smoke and cigarettes was getting to her head. She hadn't eaten dinner that night, she was so angry. "Come on dear, sit down and get high," the old woman said. "Getting angry won't help." Everyone starting laughing. Suddenly everyone was sitting on the floor in a circle, even the old woman, passing the bong around.

Needless to say, everyone was completely stoned within an hour or so. Conversations that are hardly worth recounting took place. It is worth mentioning though that Deana didn't respond well to the pot. She had never smoked before, not a single cigarette. Her father had been a smoker and it was a habit she associated uniquely with him. So, in this room full of tried and true smokers, especially the old woman who acted as some kind of convener of a convention of bad habits and vices, Deana could not keep pace.

***

No one realized at first that the only lighter in basement was gone. By that time, the two kids were asleep, the old woman was rambling on about some event or another, and Deana's neighbor and the younger woman were nodding off. The neighbor and the younger woman both came back to consciousness, though about smoking more, only to realize that the lighter was gone, and so was Deana.

"Should we look for her?" the woman asked.

"She's probably gone off to her chamber."

"Her what?"

"Chamber."

"You mean that shed."

"Yeah, she calls it a 'chamber.'"

"What does she do in there? Sew?"

They both starting laughing. "No, she sleeps. She sleeps in there. It's where she sleeps. I helped her to build it. I built it, actually."

"She sleeps there?"

"Yeah, because the radio waves or whatever are killing her."

"Oh. That's weird." 

Deana's neighbor shrugged. "I'm tired. I'm going to bed. You gonna take your mom home?"

"Yeah, what about these kids?"

"They can take care of themselves. I'm going to sleep."

Upstairs, Deana's neighbor was working his way out of his sweater and shirt, when something caught his eye. Opposite his house, a woman was crouched down in the driveway kneeling by a car. He stumbled over to his night stand light and turned it off. Closer to the window, he confirmed his hazy suspicion. It was Deana, seemingly siphoning off gas from the car into...something.

He quickly put his clothes back on and bounded down the stairs. Not bothering to put on a jacket, her neighbor ran across the street in the chill of the late autumn evening. Deana didn't stop as he approached; she seemed mesmerized by her task...or quite possibly was succumbing to the fumes. "What are you doing!?" he asked her, standing over her. She rolled her eyes up at him but didn't stop the slow process of huffing in gas into a piece of water hose and letting it lose in a battered sauce pan. Her neighbor stood there for a moment more before she stopped and stood up. She crept past him, as if she didn't see her. She ambled back across the street, zombie-like, holding her sauce pan of gasoline

Her neighbor caught up to her again and slowed to match her zombie's pace. "What are the doing? Are you nuts? Getting gas like that is totally dangerous."

"I'm burning down the chamber. I'm burning it down. It needs to some down," she said.

They continued on into her backyard. "You won't get any money for it. What if you burn your house down?" Deana shrugged. "What abour your neighbors?" But she was already pitching the gasoline out, letting splash against the sides of the chamber and roll down to the grass around it.

"It's got to come down." She pulled out the lighter form the basement, the missing lighter, and crouched down. She started flicking it very inexpertly. As anyone is likely to do, her neighbor grew impatience watching her clumsy thumb incompetently try to spark the lighter into a flame. 

"Here...let me do it," he said. Whether such a things was incredibly illegal or not, he didn't know. He even didn't know right at that moment whether or not he would torch the thing, or hand the lighter back to her and let her do the honors. He flicked it a few times...his hands were getting cold...then a orange then blue flame seemed to peer out from the lighter, flicker in the breeze, then jump into existence. He shielded the delicate thing with his hand and, in a a moment of relative sanity, handed the lighter back to her.

Deana would not have wanted it any other way. She would have grabbed that lighter from his hand, yanked it out to be more precise, if she had to do it. She bent down to light the trail of gas that they had poured from the chamber to where they stood now. Her neighbor held out his arm to block her, "Wait," he said. "Where are you going to go? You can't stay here, not if you do this."

This injection of rational thinking made her pause for a moment. "I'll leave town."

"And go where?"

She didn't know. Where would she go? This had been the only place she had ever known. But she recalled the endless days that she spent feeling miserable, wishing that she could isolate herself from the waves and beams and particles that were causing her own internal rhythms to scramble. She lived now with a constant feeling of anxiety, of pain, and desperation. Surely there was some escape from these feelings. Surely, there was some plaec for her to go to find relief. And that's when she said, "Salubrious."

"What?" her neighbor asked. "What's that?"

"A place I read about. In West Virginia. It's a retreat from...all of this." She waved her hands around. "I'll go there, and you'll drive me there."

"No, no. I'm not going to West Virginia. Not with you. I'll take you to the bus stop in the next town. You can make your way on your own."

"Okay, that's a deal." And with that Deana lit fire to the chamber and most of the back of her father's house. Deana's brother received a call a few days later from the sheriff's office informing him about the fire and that his sister had disappeared. Maybe he had wanted to say, "Don't look to hard," but mildly replied, "I'll let you know if I hear anything."


## INSIDE THE QUIET ZONE

"Mr. Jason, Mr. Jason, wake up!" Jason sat up in his conference room chair and let the conference walls and the conference room table and the conference room light overtake him. He was, needless to say, in a conference room. Had he not been asleep in the conference room, he probably would come come to this realization sooner. Jason looked up and saw the night janitor, a Polish man named Marek, whom everyone called Mark, but Jason called Marek, standing over him. "You're sleeping in the conference room again, Mr. Jason."

"Oh, really? I guess I didn't realize how late it was."

"I kept coming around to check on you, to see if you were awake, but now I have to leave. You have to wake up now, I think."

"No, you're right. I should go home."

"Yes, you have a little baby at home, don't you? I remember the pictures."

Jason did have a little baby at home, and a wife too. But he still spent many nights like this prepared to work the night through on his projects, only to find himself supine in the break room, or hunched over a copy machine asleep. In Jason's defense, the wife and the baby were both relatively new phenomenon in his life. For much of the last ten years, he had been in and out of school, and used to working at the strangest of hours. The formula generally had worked for him until he came to the quiet zone on a post-doc. He came with his new wife and their new baby in tow and life had not really settled into a routine ever since.

Since arriving in the area, Jason had felt out of sync and odd. His comments to his colleagues often came out garbled and misunderstood. His first week found him in a hour long shouting match with one of the lab's project directors. His work had been sloppy and late. In fact, each day, Jason seemed to lose grasp on his purpose and rational for being here. 

He also imagined that the pressure being put on him to perform at work extended to home as well. His wife, Paige, had voiced her concerns about his general mood and seeming unhappiness, but was generally content to live out this exile in this strange, quiet country. This didn't stop them from having arguments and arguments led to more arguments. In fact, it started to be the case that arguing and fighting took over much of their interaction. Through all of this arguing and unhappiness, Jason felt time slipping away mercilessly.

The strange thing was that he was there to study and measure time with the precise observations from the radio telescope. He was surprised by how much data came pouring in--reading from remote solar systems on the rotations and movements of particles and stars and planets. He had consumed some of the data before, but had not really seen it all streaming in all at once.

Jason had been working on a report for his fellowship advisor in the conference room when Marek found him. His laptop, which had started off the night with a crisp bright screen and happily humming fan had long since powered down in exhaustion too. Papers were scattered about. On a legal pad in front of him, Jason saw the words, "The relative size of people who are here..." and had no idea what that meant. Jason gathered up his things and rode his bike home to get a few hours of sleep before he had to return to the lab the next day.

***

Since moving here, Jason had been better about working out. At least two or three times a week, he brought along a gym bag with workout clothes and running shoes with him to the lab. He usually spent an hour in the gym on the treadmills and inexpertly using the weight equipment. This morning he was tempted to not go at all. He was particularly tired and feeling defeated. The baby and his wife were still asleep, so he showered and crept downstairs, only to find his bag sitting out for him already. He ate a quick breakfast and drank some coffee before getting on his big, gym bag in hand, and headed for the lab.

Along the way, the kept saying to himself that this day would be the day, the one where he would turn everything around. Maybe it would start by working a little harder on the treadmill, or lifting a little more in the curling machine. Maybe he would find his direction again in his research, and know, once again, why he was spending the better part of the his late twenties combing numbers for...something.

When he got to the gym, it was just opening up, a thin man in jeans and a tucked in t-shirt greeted him and invited him to swipe his security ID. Once inside, Jason headed to the locker room to change. He went through most of his usual routine and ended up lying down on an exercise mat with his damp, sweaty towel covering his face. As he lay there, he thought he heard his advisor nearby talking in a broken up, huffing voice. "I don't know where the report is," he said. "I have asked for it and asked for it."

"He doesn't seem to be working out."

"No, not at all. We must of have misjudged what he was made of exactly."

"Well, it happens. Remember that woman from India a few years back. Oh, and there was Harold too."

"Hopefully he's no Harold."

"No, as long as he stays on course and doesn't go veering off on a completely different path."

"Remains to be seen. Hard to say for sure right now."

"Have a talk with him, straighten him out."

"You know that when it gets this far there is sometimes only one route."

"True. I've seen it."

"So have I."

Jason stopped listening at this point, letting this whir of the exercise bikes drown out their voices. He was convinced that they were talking about him, and why not? Wasn't he lying on a sweaty exercise mat, aching from a little early morning exertion, trying to justify not continuing on with his work? A calmer, more rational voice stepped in at this point and advised him to go and actually talk with his advisor and try to work on the problem. Certainly he would make the first half the happen; the second part might be harder to achieve.

Jason spent the rest fo the morning working on a conference paper based on his research, or whatever parts of it there were to present. He ate a quick lunch of leftovers that he had stowed away in the refrigerator. He saw his advisor walking down the hall through the glass windows surrounding the study carrels where he was working. Jason leaped out of his seat and rushed down the hall.

"Dr. Dorian, Dr. Dorian!" he said. His advisor stopped and turned.

"Jason, how are you?

"Good, I need to talk to you today." 

Dr. Dorian looked down at his watch. "I've got a director's meeting at 3:30. It's 2:00 now. Can you walk?"

"Oh," Jason looked back over his shoulder at his table top desk, his computer and work. "Sure, just let me grab my coat."

"Okay, hurry up." Jason joined back up with the seemingly impatient Dr. Dorian and they started to walk down the long corridor that led to a complex of small offices over to the administrative buildings for the lab. Out in the sun, crossing the green lawn between the building, seeing the mountains rising up around them, Jason felt much clearer, much more sane. He started to wonder why he was confronting his advisor at all. But here he was; he had to say something. "What's on your mind, Jason?"

"I owe you a research report."

"That's true. You do. When were you planning to give that to me?"

"By the end of the week."

"Okay, that's fine. I'm going out of town this weekend for a conference. Have it to my by Thursday." Today was Tuesday."

"Sure, I'll send it to you then. But, Dr. Dorian, that's not all." They both stopped at the same time. "Look, I realize that I'm struggling. I know that I'm behind the other post-docs."

"Yes, you are. I won't deny that."

"I'm not sure what's going on."

"Jason, there's no doubt that you're a bright student. You have done some amazing work up till now. We all go through growing pains becoming researchers. You have stop being a student and become a researcher. You have to understand too that there is pressure on me to get you to perform. We don't want post-docs just fading away. This isn't a humanities  program. We have to think about the budget and the health of this program."

With each passing phrase, Dr. Dorian seemed to up the pressure on Jason, rather than diminish it. Jason started to squirm a bit, and they both started walking again.

"Jason, I have to level with you. I'm being told to cut you loose in a month. The director wants to see your work--a presentation, a report--I don't know what. But if you can't produce he wants to cut his losses. Why don't you do this...finish working up your results for me, get them posted, then take the weekend off. You have a wife, right?"

"Yes, and a son." Jason wasn't sure if he was writing on the doctor's face a seemingly frown and furrow of disapproval at this interjection.

"Well, take your wife and son and get away, go up in the mountains. Take a hike. Spend the night in a lodge. Try not to think about work. Clear your head. We all need breaks from this," he said. "I have to finish up some work before that meeting. Will I see that report?"

"Yes, I'll get it to you."

Jason stood in the middle of the lab's large lawn watching Dr. Dorian fade into the doorway of the administrative complex. Off in the distance, Jason could wee the metal work of the radio telescope peaking up over the buildings. He wondered what the sound of their conversation sounded like to the telescope, to this exquisite piece of machinery that could be pointed and aimed in fractionally small increments, could detect radio frequencies traveling across the gulfs of time and space. What did their conversation sound like to that machine? Would such a sensitive instrument even register the subtle waves of comfort and cajoling that emanated from the doctor?

***

Somehow, Jason did manage to finish writing his report for Dr. Dorian. He submitted it and took a three hour nap before his wife got home from work with the baby. When she did, she was juggling her brief case, a plastic bag of groceries whose handles seemed stretched beyond the point of holding. She also had the baby in its car seat slung up in the crook of her arm. "Can you help me?" she asked. She wasn't irritated but her voice was strained. 

Picking up on just that strain of irritation put Jason in a bad mood. He was already feeling little moody from his overly long nap, or rather groggy .This was a frequent occurrence for him--taking a long nap to recover his head, only to find himself fighting off waves of fatigue from the nap itself. It was times like these that he wished he could reposition everything around him and start over, his a reset switch again. He fought back his own wave of irritation and depression, he tried at least. He quickly wondered how they would ever be able to cope with everything going on around them.

Fortunately he had these thoughts while grabbing the car seat out his wife's hands. He took the baby into the dining room of their apartment and sat him down on the floor. The baby was asleep too, but started crying when Jason set him down on the floor. Jason pulled up a chair and started rocking the car seat and signing. That didn't work, so he unstrapped the baby from the seat and cradled him in his small striped pajamas.

Jason cupped the tiny hatted head in his hands and began pacing the apartment with his son. The baby calmed down a bit and really was relaxed once Jason found a pacifier for him. The feelings that had threatened to over rule him before vanished away for a few moments and he sat down with his son in an arm chair and hummed made up tunes to him.

When his wife came in the living room, she said, "We can't take Carl to day care on Friday. Hildy is taking the day off."

"That's short notice," he said.

"Yes, but that's the way it is."

"It's not a problem."

"I'm going to have to take off work, but I have a ton of work to do."

"Oh, that's too bad. I was thinking that we should go away this weekend."

"Jason, it's just not going to happen. Besides, what about last month. I wanted to go away, but you couldn't."

"I finished that report and turned it in."

"And so now you can go out of town?"

The banter was turning ugly quickly between them.

"Maybe we should talk about this later."

"Maybe."

Later didn't occur until about three hours later after dinner had been made and the baby put down for the night. Paige was propped up in bed, reading a magazine. Jason came into the bedroom having just gone in to quiet down the baby who always rebounded back from sleep after 30 minutes or so. "He's finally asleep," he said, rolling onto the bed next to her.

She didn't put down the magazine at first; he didn't say anything and just waited for her. "So, what are we going to do about this weekend?" he asked.

"I am swamped at work this week," she said. "We have auditors coming next week and I have to make sure everything is in order."

"That's fine. It's really no problem. I'll stay home with the bub that day."

"What about you're work."

"It'll be fine. I need a break."

"But what about Dr. Dorian?"

"No, that's it. He's the one that told me to take a break. To get away this weekend."

Paige straightened herself upon hearing this. "What does that mean, Jason?"

"It doesn't mean anything. He just thought I should take a little break. You know, get in touch with nature, that sort of thing."

Even though they hadn't been married very long, Paige and Jason had been together for several years. Paige had never known him when he wasn't in graduate school, struggling and scrambling to build his career. She knew enough about academia to feel suspicious about a higher up telling someone to take a break. It ran counter to everything that she had ever heard from Jason about academics.

"Jason, look at me and tell me that nothing is going on."

Jason looked at her, trying to muster as much sincerity as he could, "No, nothing. I swear, nothing."

"Jason, really? Are you sure?"

"Yes, I'm sure. Everything is fine. Maybe on Saturday we should do something. Take the baby to the park, get some lunch."

"That sounds nice."

***

Jason survived the next few days knowing that he would have the weekend to unwind. On Friday, he got Paige out of the door and turned his attention to the baby. What would they do today? he wondered. Feeling uncertain about what would happen on Saturday, JAson decided that he would take the baby for a hike. He got his shoulder bag packed with snacks and diapers and a change of clothes. He started to feel stressed out about how much time it was taking to leave, but managed to get a hold of himself and get the baby out of the door.

He drove with the baby a few miles outside of town to a trail head that had been created by a local boy scout troop countless years ago. He sat off into the rolling foothills of the mountains with the baby cradled in front of him in a sling.

He walked for about an hour, turning around once he sensed the baby getting restless in the sling. When he got back in the car, he headed down the road back to town. After about a mile, he noticed that the car began pulling heavily to right. He pulled over the car and realized that the tire had gone flat. Of course, they didn't have a spare tire in the back, the spare tire being the very one that just went flat.

Additionally, he had not way of contacting Paige to let her know. One of the strange things about coming to the radio free zone had been leaving things like their cell phones behind. The strict limitations on what devices could be used when and where took some getting used to. Jason was surprised, though, by how quickly they grew accustomed to not having some of the conveniences of modern life. Of course, it was times like these that he wished had been any where other than this 500 square mile swath of land where no cell phones were allowed.

Just up ahead, he saw a turn off that must lead to a house. It probably wasn't far, so Jason go the baby and decided to walk. He walked for about 15 minutes before he was standing on the porch of an old cabin. This cabin wasn't like the old farm houses and hunting shacks that littered the country side. A BMW was parked in beside the house. The yard surrounding the cabin had been kept up meticulously, plants and flowers ran amok, but did so with a kind of artistic flair to them. Nature could never have been that artfully disorganized.

He knocked several times on the door and no one answered. Finally, a man came down a stair case tying a bath robe around him. He was an older man, receding hair, a gray mustache. Obviously old, obviously well off. He opened the door and studied Jason, taking particular notice of the baby. He seemed to step into the doorway, filling up as much of the space as he could. "Can I help you?"

"Sorry to bother you..."

"It's not a bother, I'd just like to know why you're here."

"Uh, excuse me."

"We're somewhat out of the way here, yet here you are with a baby. It raises suspicions, you know. Where's your car? How did you get here?"

Jason realized that there was someone standing behind him at the bottom of the stairs that led up to porch. A large stocky man wearing dark cowboy boots, dirty jeans, and a heavy denim shirt dusted off his white cowboy hat and put it back on his head. The man didn't say anything, didn't make eye contact with Jason, just leaned heavily on the stair railing.

"So, do you want to tell me why you're here."

Jason tried to to explain himself, "It's just my car. I got a flat down the road.

"What were you doing out here, young man?"

"Just hiking, with my baby."

"And what exactly were you expecting me to do?"

Before Jason could speak, he saw someone else enter the scene. A woman was coming down the same stairs that this off putting man had, also wrapping herself in a robe. Jason wasn't exactly sure what kind of scene he had entered into. Was this some kind of sordid adulterous romance playing itself out? Why the enforcer behind him. He became very conscious of the baby hanging from around him. He felt very vulnerable both because he couldn't just dart off down the road, but also because he would have to protect his son at all cost.

"Who is that Anthony?"

"No one, just having a chat." The man, presumably Anthony had turned back to look at the woman, whom Jason noticed to be an attractive woman, maybe in her mid-thirties, maybe older. 

The woman walked up behind him and threw the door open. "Oh, what a cute baby. Anthony, what's going on."

The man looked at him looking at her and seemed to read something there. "This young man got a flat and needs some help."

Just then the baby started fussing. "What's your name?" the woman asked

"Jason, my name is Jason."

"Antohny, why don't you get Terry to take car of the car, I'm just he won't mind." Anthony nodded to the man in the white cowboy hat who nodded back, disappeared, then reappeared seated in a golden and brown pick up truck. The truck kicked up dust down the road before making a hard turn onto the rutted road back to the car.

The man and the woman let Jason come inside and feed his son a bottle. The woman cooed over the baby and asked to hold him. Jason decided it was best to not ask many questions, particularly once the man left him alone with the woman. He kept his eyes on the baby and kept all conversation on him as well.

When the man named Anthony reappeared, he was dressed. "You're car is in the driveway. Terry brought it up for you."

Jason took this as an obvious invitation to leave and did so gladly. He returned home hoping that the rest of the weekend would be a little less eventful than this very strange day.


## LOST IN LOUISVILLE

Dr. Conroy had not know how much longer he could tolerate Henry. The man had nearly managed to get him arrested on two occasions, not counting the little chase scene at the Wal-Mart. Henry had been hit during a bar fight, had stolen a pack of cigarette and probably made countless women uncomfortable along the way. Yet Dr. Conroy kept picking his traveling companion off of the floor and getting him back in the car. 

The reasons for this were not entirely clear to him, even now. Maybe he felt like Henry really had become his patient and was in his care. Maybe he was more afraid of what would happen if Henry strayed away from him than not. Despite these conflicted feelings, the doctor decided that he would try one last time to get rid of Henry. He decided that Lousiville would be the place.

They entered the city from the north, crossing over the river on the large metal bridges, backed up with traffic. "I've got some business to attend to here. I'm going to leave you to fend for yourself."

The doctor dropped Henry off in front of a drug store in downtown Louisville. "I'll pick you up in three days, right here," he said. Surprisingly, Henry got out of the car and started to wander off down the sidewalk. The doctor pulled away not entirely convinced that he was going to return or not. Only time would tell.

After dropping Henry off, the doctor drove to an old residential section of the city  to a white clapboard house that resembled something between a shot gun shack and tiny bungalow. Increasingly the neighbor around this little house was changing and young couples bought up cheap houses and refurbished them. Many of the houses in front of the peeling shabby white one where he parked the car were bright pastels or subtle gradients of brown, ringed with plants, littered with art, and exuding an air of causal, yet studied cultivation.

He turned the car off and proceeded inside the small white house. Upon entering, he was overwhelming first by how dark the house was and how small it seemed to him. The the odor of cat urine overtook him as well. "Hello!?" he yelled out, moving to pick up some newspapers from floor, only to realize that they were covering up other, slightly damp newspapers from underneath. He dropped the papers back down and walked down the narrow hallway. From the back of the house he could hear the rattling of a window unit, and the sound of dripping water. An old woman was coughing too. 

There she was, the old woman, sitting at a metal table by the small wall of a kitchen at the back of the house, a rivulet of water was creeping up to her, running out from the bathroom. The doctor realized that he was walking through a small pond that was forming around the bathroom sink where a steady flow of water was running down from the overflowing sink.

He turned the water off and proceeded to mop up as much of the water as he could with whatever towels he could find. The ones that he could find were mostly hardened into strange shapes and so musty smelling that he could hardly stand to handle them. The doctor was not a particular man and had put up with some pretty unsavory conditions in his time, but seeing this scene was getting to him.

Despite shutting off the sink and sopping up a good bit of the water, there was still water going this way and that. He yanked the sheets from the bed in the small bedroom next to the bathroom and wiped up the rest of the water with that. Then he went around the house collecting anything washable that he could find, carried it out to the car and found a laundromat.

He sat wordlessly, blankly in the laundromat for several hours, feeding quarter after quarter into the quarter hungry washing machines and dryers. One the las load finished, he steeled himself for the return to the house where he would find his mother doing god knows what.

***

The doctor refused to sleep in the house that night. He parked his car in the empty, slightly tilted garage behind the house and slept there. He had become so used to sleeping in the car, that a feeling of security and comfort accompanied his preparations to sleep. In the morning, he went inside to shower, only to find that there was no hot water available. He continued on with it anyway, wrapping himself up in a fresh smelling towel that had been cleaned the day before. He got his mother up from bed and changed her clothes. He brushed her hair then moved her into the kitchen.

He had not seen his mother in several years. When he last saw her, her condition was not good, but he decided that he could not wait around there to watch her get better. Things were much worse now. She hardly seemed to recognize her and didn't seem very interested in engaging in conversation either. It amazed him that she was still functioning at all, but somehow she managed to move about and live. 

He cooked her breakfast and stationed her in the living room in front of the television. Certainly watching her programs had been a regular part of her life, and this did not change now. He went back to the kitchen to decide how best to proceed. The doctor made a trip to the grocery store and bought cleaning supplies, not a bleach, large trash bags, rubber gloves. At a hardware store, he picked up a respirator, just to make the job a little more bearable. 

He spent most of the remainder of that day picking up, throwing out junk, and scrubbing, scrubbing away. The day ended with him calling animal control to cage the numerous cats that were running around the house. 

He knew, based on what he was seeing that his mother could not be left like this, but what could he do? 

The next day, a woman showed up on the front porch and was surprised to see Dr. Conroy answering the door. "Who are you?" he asked, not meanign to sound so suspicious.

"I'm your mother's case worker. I've been checking on her for the last few weeks. Are you her son?"

"I am. Nick, Nick Cavill."

"Mrs. Cavill isn't doing well, Nick. I really think that we need a plan for her."

"What kind of plan?"

"Well, i would like to keep her in her home, but I don't think it's realistic, unless she can have more support around the house."

"Can't you get people to come in?"

"That's not the kind of help that I was thinking of."

"Look, it can't be me. It just can't be. I know it should be, but I have...business interests in other states. I was just passing through town."

"WEll, the house looks much better than it did. But, you do realize that your mother is on the road to becoming a ward of the state, don't you?"

"I guess that I do. I just don't know."

For the first time, his mother interjected a comment. "I don't want you marrying that bitch. She said." A soft, wrinkled hand hovering in space and pointed at the women. She looked at her son directly for the first time since he arrived. "You don't marry that bitch, you hear. She's trying to take this house away from me. I won't stand it."

"Mother, no one..." But the case worker motioned him to stop and he did. They walked back to the kitchen where he started asking questions in a whisper, "Do, what am I supposed to do? I have to leave town tomorrow."

"I would recommend that..." Neither of them heard or saw the old woman come up behind the case worker with her cane raised. She swung with whatever reserve of strength she had at the case worker's head. The woman fainted into Dr. Conroy's arms. He grabbed her and sat her down in one of the dining room chairs, feeling at the back of her head for blood.

His mother was already heading back to the living room. The doctor did not know what the do and just started at the slumped over woman, watching her nervously for signs of life. He knew that he was going to have to call an ambulance and that meant the police and who knew what else. Meanwhile the only person probably on his mother's side was sitting there semi-consciously in the dining room.


***

The EMTs came quickly and check out the case worker, who had revived just before their arrival. Dr. Conroy had given her some ice and a glass of water. The woman just sat there not saying anything, but in a completely passive and accepting way. The doctor was surprised that she wasn't angry over this incident. She did insist, however, that the police officer who had also shown up on the scene fill out a report. The officer insisted that that the doctor come to the police station to finish completing the report [this probably doesn't make much sense, oh well].

At the station, Dr. Conroy finished his business with the officer quickly. As he was leaving, he saw sitting in the booking room a man who looked remarkably like Henry. The doctor must have looked a little too long, because just then Henry look up and over at him and gave him a large, leering, and toothy smile. He started nodding silently again at the office who was processing him. 

Dr. Conroy knew that he could turn around and walk right out the doors of the station and never look back. He could rid himself of this man named Henry and not have to worry about him ruining his future plans, which he would inevitably do. He did not turn back at first. He exited the station through its smooth swooshing sliding door and crossed most of the parking lot before something inside of him stopped him in his tracks. 

This decision, this line of action, did not feel right to him. Again, as with everything having to do with his man, the doctor did not clearly understand his own motivations. But, he knew that leaving Henry behind would not sit well with him in the long run. This change of heart might seem surprising given the kind of work that the doctor was accustomed to. Throughout his interactions with numerous patience and practitioners of his various cures and methods, he always was able to distance himself from them and their ailments. He always felt that everyone involved was participating in an elaborate lie whose complexity and scale made it almost indistinguishable form complex "real" interactions. 

He did not feel bad for these people who had chosen to believe him and his message about this cure or that. Their belief was contingent on that initial choice, hinged on that delicate pivot point. But what about Henry? The chaos inside that man made him seems beyond illusions like these, somehow incapable of participating in the collective delusion that Dr. Conroy, over the years, had come to simply accept as life itself.

The doctor turned back to the station and inquired at the desk about the man who had been sitting in the booking room. "And you are?" the officer on duty asked.

"I'm his doctor. I have been treating him. He is very emotionally unsteady right now. I'm worried about the effects of being in jail for too long. The officer at the desk indicated that he was being held at least over night. "Visiting hours are in an hour if you want to wait." Faced with the option of going back to his mother's house and sitting at the police station, Dr. Conroy decided to wait. 

When it was time for visiting hours, he let the police officer know that he would speak to Henry. A guard brought out Henry who seemed likely to collapse in exhaustion. After only a few days, Henry looked much more ragged and worn down than the doctor remembered. "What brought you here doctor?" Henry asked in a slurred voice; he clearly was still a little drunk. "Besides yourself, that is!" He chuckled at his joke.

"Nevermind that, I'm going to try to get you out."

"Not gonna let me rot here in Louisville, you're home town. Wonder what I could find out about you here. Already learned some interesting stuff." Was Henry threatening him, or just lacking any tact or social grace. Didn't he see that the doctor was sticking his neck out to help him?

The doctor did a quick mental inventory. What possibly could Henry have learned about him after only a fews days of being in town. Probably nothing too damaging--story about getting a girl pregnant, a disorderly conduct arrest, a few check cashing scams that he had run. It seemed pretty run of the mill to him. As far as he could remember, he didn't have anything to worry about. 

"I'd just keep my ears very, very wide open and just let the stories pour in. Seems to be all that I have to do, no matter where I go."

AGain, what kinds of stories could these be? The doctor leaned in and hissed, "Now might be a great time to be threatening me. I'm going to try to get you out."

"Very good of you. Show me the door."

"Not quite there yet. I need a plan and don't have one."

"Find a bondsman."

"Well, that might be an option, but you need to rein it in a little or the money won't show up."

"Oh, yes, of course. Of course doctor. And maybe I won't bring up the fact that you were trying to case me aside, and leave me here in this place. I don't know what kind of person would do that sort of thing, but I found the lesson to be very eye opening."

Now it was the doctor's turn to lash out, "Something that your wallet reading didn't tell you, I guess. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, I do have a reputation to uphold. Certain appearances have to be maintained."

"Yes, oh, yes. By all means. Exhausting work it must be too--keeping up all of those appearances."

The doctor stood up to leave. "I'm not going to carry on like this with you, but I will get you out of jail. I take some responsibility for that. In the meantime, why don't you try not to cause any trouble."

Unfortunately for the doctor, he imagined trouble taking a variety of forms between now and when he could get Henry out. Between this man and his mother, the doctor felt a little unequipped to deal with everything. He desperately hoped that his mother's case worker would come through ad be able to sort everything out with an assisted living facility.


## THE MAN WITH THE WHITE HAT

For the first year that he lived in the quiet zone, Anthony felt very at peace. Almost daily he had visions of himself becoming a real man of the country. He bought an old brown and yellow pickup truck from a neighbor whose farm was being foreclosed. Anthony parked the pickup next to his BMW and felt very satisfied with it.From the army and navy store in town, he bought hiking boots and camping equipment, deciding that when the weather was warmer, he would take a camping trip.

As word spread around town about him, he became known as a kind of local eccentric billionaire. No one knew exactly what he did or where he got his money from, but everyone knew that he was rich. Of course, his net worth had been inflated well beyond any reasonable amount for a bachelor living off a few stock dividends. But there he was living in the country, driving his fancy car, and eating out three or four times a week. People talked about him and facts changed and shifted as they did.

The effect of these stories wasn't wholly unwelcome though. All types of people tried to curry favor with him, to gain his notice. Increasingly, he found it difficult to go anywhere without someone trying to talk his ear off. Most often these encounters centered around business deals or giving to a particular charity. He was a favorite with a local seniors home for helping out handsomely with a Christmas gift giving drive. He had even made a few personal loans to  his neighbors.

Of course when the people taking notice of him were the beautiful young women in town, Anthony didn't mind at all. But this wasn't the only attention that he received. Occasionally he sensed that people were following too closely behind him as he walked down the street. Maybe someone was starting at him from across the grocery store, or eying him through a store window. These lingering gazes could unsettle him as much as the pretty, fleeting glances could excite him.

It wasn't until he finally made his first real foray into the hills around his new home that he experienced the full consequences of new found notoriety. He settled on a weekend early in the fall to hike into the mountains for a few hours and make camps for a night. He packed up his backpack and prepared a few basic meals to take with him--sandwiches, nuts, dried fruit, and water. 

The leaves were bursting into colors around him that weekend and falling to the ground as quickly as they did. Much of his hike was over a dense covering of leaves, a patchwork of greens and browns and oranges that were slowly fading into one another. His hike was mostly pleasant, though he realized that the gear he purchased in town was a little too clunky and heavy for his taste. He would probably need to to upgrade to something made out of bullet proof kevlar or something else derived from space age materials and processes. For the time, being, though, he was pretty sure that he could he make it on a little further.

After a few hours, though, the wicking shirt that he purchased had turned from a light tan to a translucent brown. He was starting to heave a little bit and the boot that he had barely broken in were chaffing his feet. He decided that it would be a good time to stop and make camp where he was. The scene wasn't particularly idyllic, but he noticed a small clearing off in the distance that would suffice.

By this time, the sun was setting and light was fading all around him. He had just finished snacking from his pouch of nuts when he thought that he heard then saw someone coming down the trail. The person flitted out of view before he could get a good look. He was pretty sure, however, that the person he saw was a woman out alone without any gear or equipment.

Maybe she had a camp nearby, he thought, but realized that he hadn't really seen or heard anyone in some time. Moreover, he didn't smell any camp fires beside his own. From where he was sitting, he kept a close watch for the person, who flitted into view again then disappeared. After seeing her again--and he confirmed that it was a she--he got up to try to find her. The scene was strange enough that he was clutching at his pocket knife, though what good that would really have been was an open question.

As he walked further and further in the direction of the figure, he felt himself receding further and further into the woods, away from his little camp and the rough trail that he had followed. The underbrush and trees were starting to thin out as he went further up the mountain. Just then the woman came into full view. She was turned to face him, smiling him, hands on her hips. She laughed and turned, starting to sprint past him, back in the direction they came. Spellbound as he was, Anthony shouted, "Hey, stop!" For all he knew the words were as meaningless as stupid animal braying.

He stood motionless there in that spot for several minutes before his consciousness snapped back into place. He started to run back after her, but had to quit after several minutes of exertion. He kept walked back in the direction of camp--and could see the tendrils of his camp fire smoke emerging from the trees and into the sky--but worried that the growing dark would make ti hard to see. He finally did make it back, however, and could do nothing but sit on his log stool, catch his breath, and wonder at himself for running after a woman who was flitting around the woods at night.

***

Anthony wasn't a superstitious or religious man, per se. He had a completely normal and uninteresting degree of belief in the uncommon, unusual, and bizarre. sometimes this belief could incline him to thinking that the supernatural was feasible and operative in everyday life, but this line of thinking rarely led to any professions of faith in what he though he saw or heard. This encounter, however, rattled him a bit. He wondered if he had not encountered some kind of mythological spirit of the woods. Maybe he had encountered something older than the land itself, but cloaked in modern dress and able to run at quite a clip.

He had dreams that night of prophecies and forests and giant spectral creatures. He imagined himself entrained by nymphs, like some kind of Greek prince. It was all very heady and intoxicating stuff. So much so that he really didn't think through any possible real-word implications of being led into the woods by a total stranger for who know what purpose.

It wasn't until he got home that a sliver of that purpose became a little clearer. Before that, though, he slept through the night fairly soundly. In the morning, he retrieved his camp food from its spot up in the tree and back up camp. He kicked over his small fire and buried the ashes. He tried to be a good, conscientious camper.

As he hiked back home, he didn't experience the rush of peace and harmony that he had expected to feel. Instead, he wondered endlessly about the woman he saw last night--who she was and why he had seen her. Perhaps this didn't mean that his excursion had been a complete failure. He certainly walked faster and was thinking faster than he had before coming on the trip. Something had been spurred to wake up inside of him, he just wasn't expecting for this to be the way that it felt.

He still noticed his feet hurting and the backpack straps pulling at his shoulders, but he didn't mind it as much. Instead, he planned out how he would go about finding out about the woman. He could probably ask a few people around town in a very subtle and low-key fashion first. Anthony wasn't entirely sure if subtle and low-key were operative concepts for the towns folk, but he could give it a go. But, he wouldn't go to the police, not at first. That seemed extreme and likely to open himself up to questions he wasn't prepared to answer. 

Things could get tricky, he realized, if she disappeared or wound up dead. If he was going around town announcing that he was the last and maybe the only person to see a young woman who was resting in peace now, people would probably start to draw some pretty firm conclusions about him. No, he would have to be very subtle and somewhat cunning to keep any suspicion off of himself. Again, despite all of the peace and quiet that Anthony had enjoyed up to now, he could probably best be described in this moment as being happy, happier than he had been for some time. Maybe it was the mystery, the thrill of a hunt, but he was eager to see what would happen next.

The only problem was that he wasn't entirely prepared for what happened next. When he got back to the pickup truck, he loaded up his gear and headed back home. As he rounded the corner near his house and started up the driveway, he noticed that there was someone standing on his front porch. no, in fact, there was someone standing and another person sitting. 

The standing person seemed very relaxed, reclining back on an elbow against the stair rails, chewing on a toothpick. The man, from what Anthony could gather as he got closer, wore a large white cowboy hat. Otherwise, he looked like a somewhat unremarkable field hand or worker of some sort. Only it was his poise and pose that made him stand out. The man seemed like a dynamo of energy that was coiled up inside waiting to unfurl.

The sitting person was much less impressive seeming and somewhat less interesting to observe. The sitting man clearly had his hands bound together and had been gagged. The man was squirming on the step of the front porch, and got an occasional shove to encourage him to sit still by the other man's dusty brown booted foot.

He got out of the car, clutching his pocket knife stupidly again, and walked up to the stairs. The man in the white hat tipped his head and nodded. "Morning, mister," he said.

"What's going on here?"

"Well, I found this man here trying to break into your house. I should say, that I found him inside your house."

"Really, and you did what exactly?"

"Let's just say I apprehended him." It was then that Anthony noticed a few red marks on the other man's face and arms that would probably be swelling and bruising soon. "Oh, and I'd guess that you're missing a few hundred dollars from your wallet. Am I wrong?"

Anthony pulled out his wallet. It did feel lighter. He opened it and flipped through it. He was missing money. He wasn't however, connecting any of the dots that were being put out in front of him.

"Are you some kind of police officer? Are you arresting this man?"

"No...no...not a police officer. Let's just say that we don't often see side to side. I'm more of what you'd call a bounty hunter. I've come to collect my due."

These last words struck Anthony as being both sinister and vaguely threatening towards himself. Was there something form him that this overly relaxed, yet powerful looking, man expected to collecting from him too?

"I've got to take this man back to North Carolina. He's been running from the law for quite some time now."

"Did he take anything?" Anthony asked, wanting to ask the man in the cowboy hat if he had taken anything either, but the expressionless, almost lazy stare that the man gave him persuaded him not to ask.

"Don't think so. Not much in there to take, if you ask me. He wasn't in there for long anyway."

"And my money?"

"Well, you're money is long gone. Oh, well, maybe it's not..."

Anthony felt a gun being pressed to the back of neck just then. It didn't feel like a particular large or small gun, but a gun whose proximity to his brain and spinal column made it lethal not matter its size. "Sit down, mister and don't do anything stupid or I'll blow your fucking brains out."

Anthony crept forward with the gun still pressed to his neck. He couldn't really see who was behind him, but the voice was a woman's and he could tell that the gun was pointing up, meaning that the person was shorter than him. He got to the stairs and sat down next tot he gagged man. The woman, which was who he was facing now, seemed to be the very same woman from the mountains.

To say that Anthony was disappointed by this would be an understatement. His visions and dreams of entering a world of golden age myths and of fairies and nymphs dancing about him naked came to an abrupt halt. This woman was certain pretty enough--fit and trim and very attractive. But the gun his face led his thoughts in an different direction altogether.

The woman pointed the gun at the man in the white cowboy hat who, up till now, had not moved and seemed to be existing outside of this strange little scene. When woman pointed it at him and the man said, "Uh-uh." He stepped forward quickly, grabbed the gun from her hand and twisted her arm arm, pulling her down to the ground with all of his force.

The woman cried out in pain and frustration. With her arm twisted painfully around, he led her to the stairs too. Now they were all sitting in a row. The man slipped the gun into his waist band of his pants and said, "Get up mister, you're not part of the line up." Anthony sat down and looked at the tow criminals who had been apprehended on his front porch.

"Should I call the sheriff? The police" he asked.

"No, no...no need to get them involved. Is there?" The man and woman both shook their heads. Let's just mosy on down the road a bit to my truck and be on our way. no need to bother this nice gentleman anymore, is there?" Again, they both shook their heads. He grabbed them both and dragged them up to a standing position. They started to follow him, though the woman did make a lunge for the gun. The man in the white cowboy hat, however, was just too fast for her. He retried the gun first, push her back, sending her reeling back a few steps.

The man in the white hat had the gun drawn on her so quickly. So much quicker than either of them could ever have hoped."Keep walking, beautiful," he said, clearly responding to the girl. "Now y'all wave good bye to this nice man, let's promise to not bother him any more, okay?" he said. Both the man and the woman, who really had only recently entered the true ranks of criminals, nodded and continued to be led on their way.

***

A few weeks later Anthony still did not have his money back. He wasn't exactly sure who had it. Had the man in the white cowboy hat worked him over in an elaborate con to get the money. Had he conned the con artists too, or they really hurting so much. It wasn't so much that the amount of money taken from him had been that large, it was more that he felt foolish for getting wrapped up in a fantasy they way he did. 

It didn't long, however, before Anthony saw the man in the white cowboy hat again. Once in a while, Anthony passed through town and drove out to a small roadhouse that sat at the junction of two county roads. The roadhouse was an unassuming two story white stucco building with a large deck in the back and plenty of parking. On the weekends people drove their trucks and motorcycles and piled up inside and out of the place.

On this particular evening, Anthony drove his old pickup truck to the roadhouse to eat a hamburger and have a few beers. He liked simple pleasures like this and living in the radio free zone allowed him to do this. He nodded and waved to a few people that he recognized, but always sat in a small booth alone, eating and reading the newspaper that he brought in folded under his arms. Beside the din of people talking, and bright whirling jukebox in the corner that was occasionally played, the place was noticeable for the absence of televisions and radios.

Midway through his little pleasurable meal, Anthony looked over from his paper and noticed the man with the white cowboy hat sitting at the bar. The man didn't attempt to hide his presence. In the same direct way that he had confronted the woman with the gun on the porch, he leaned heavily into the bar and nodded at Anthony. He had a simple, matter of fact look on his face.

In other words, there was nothing but the force of his presence and being that unsettled Anthony. The man wasn't outwardly hostile. But why was he there at all? That was the question that began to make Anthony squirm. Perhaps he was there to return the money, but it really was a trivial sum. Anthony thought back to the vague threating sounding words that the man in the white cowboy hat had spoken before. Maybe like some kind of avenging spirit, that man was there to correct some wrong and undo the effects of some past crime.

Anthony decided that the best way to handle this situation was to act casual and let the man approach him. If there was some course of action that would unfold, it would unfold--the man in the cowboy hat would see to that. So, Anthony finished his burger, left money on the table for the waitress and got up to take a piss.

He was pissing in the restroom when an obviously drunken man came into the bathroom. The man was observing himself closely in the mirror above the sink, picking his teeth, and wobbling. He must have noticed Anthony looking at him and said, "Whater you lookin' at?"

Anthony was in an awkward position at the moment. He zipped up his fly and turned towards the man. "Nothing, just wondering if I could get to sink"

"Guess when I'm done. And I ain't done, am I? Or were you waitin' for an invitation?"

"No, nothing like that."

"You ain't from here, are you?" The man stepped up closer to him now.

"No, I can't say that I am."

"Yeah, now I recognize you. You're that billionaire that everyone keeps talking about. my wife and her friends can't keep jabbering about you. I can't stand it."

"I'm sorry to hear, do you mind if I wash my hands and leave."

The man planted his hand on the wall, barring Anthony from passing. "Yeah, I do mind. I'm gonna show you how much I mind too."

At that moment, the door the rest room opened. Suddenly, the man in front of Anthony was being hurled sideways into the sink. The man in the white cowboy hat picked the man up by his collar, planted him against the wall and gave him a swift punch in the gut. "Next time I'll send your head through that sink, you understand. Now get out here."

The drunk man, who surprisingly didn't look scathed at all, strode out the restroom like a completely sober man. Anthony stood reeling at the swift and sudden display of power that he saw before him. Would that same power now turn against him.

The man in the white cowboy hat took off his hat to reveal a heavy skull and closely cropped hair. He hung his hat from the edge of the toilet stall, washed his hand and dried them on the rolling cloth hand dryer on the wall. He put his hat back on and said, "Looks like you need yourself some protection, mister."

"I guess that I do," Anthony said.


## OFF THE BUS

When she finally got off the bus in Ruston, Deana was cranky, tired, and ready to not be on a bus. Fortunately for her, the driver was feeling the same way and nearly made her get off 500 miles back, 200 miles back, and 20 miles back. But Deana had managed to settle down enough to get through those last 20 miles and arrive in Ruston.

She only had a duffel bag of belonging with her, nothing else. After traveling on buses for several days she smelled bad and her clothes were starting to smell and look limp. Of course, this wasn't the first time she had been off the bus during her trip. She had been on and off of buses several times to wait for hours while once bus replaced another and people jockeyed for position on the next bus to arrive.

A few other people got off the bus with her. Those people had quickly disappeared into cars or down streets which they recognized and invited them to walk along. Deana didn't know which direction to start off in and there certainly wasn't anyone there waiting to take her in. Not knowing exactly what to do with herself, Deana walked into a brightly lit diner and cafe across the street from the service station that doubled as a bus station too.

The two waitresses who worked in the diner were bustling behind the large square counter that occupied the central part of the restaurant. They didn't acknowledge her when she walked in, so Deana sat down on a short swiveling stool at the counter and waited to be recognized. She sat there for a few minutes, eying the waitresses, shifting nervously back and forth. She wanted so badly to start shouting at one of these women but somehow managed to contained herself again.

Finally, a dark haired waitress put down a paper place mat, silverware, and a menu, then bounced away. The place was busy, but it didn't seem impossibly so. But Deana chose to accept this for what it was and settled on a cup of soup and coffee. She ordered, waited some more, then ate her meal when it was placed in front of her. 

With this meal, Deana had basically exhausted her resources. The bus tickets had been expensive, and she had had to eat along the way. She knew that she would have to find a place to stay and food, but where? During the long hours on the bus, she had been studying the pamphlet she had advertising the place called "Salubrious." The advertisement suggested that this place had an open door policy to anyone who was suffering from sickness caused by waves in the air. The only problem with this brochure, however, was that the precise details about this refugee's location were lacking.

She knew that it was in or around Ruston, she just had to find it. The man sitting near her hadn't taken much notice of him. He sat in his heavy work coat, talking with a few other men who must have been carpenters or something like that. They seemed to be talking about their jobs and people at those jobs with a keen interest. Finally, she tapped the man on the shoulder. He turned, acted surprised to see her, and said, "Yeah?"

"Do you know anything about a place called 'Salubrious'?" she asked.

"Uh, no."

"What's that?" asked his gray haired and mustached companion. This man had sunglasses propped up on his head. His face was weathered and wrinkled from working outdoor. 

"She wants to know about a place called Salubrious."

"Nope, never heard of it. Is it a town?"

"No, I don't think so," she said. "It's just a place. I was reading about it and want to find it."

"Well, I don't know anything about it," said the younger man who proceeded to turn back to the conversation. As if her mere presence had been noxious, however, the three men quickly left after this exchange. Their departure naturally inspired Deana's paranoid tendencies, leading her to believe that they knew everything about Salubrious, but were denying her access to the information.

Situation likes these were liable to send Deana into a kind a paralytic rage. Fortunately, she was too tired to brandish a buttered knife against them and compel them to tell the truth. So, they left and she knew nothing more about Salubrious. She tried asking the waitress too, but she shrugged and said she didn't know anything. 

She's too lazy to ask anyone too, though Deana. And, maybe she was right, because the waitress didn't ask anyone else. The waitress merely collected Deana's money, returned some change and went about her business. Not knowing what to do, Deana just decided to wander around for a while. She figured that she could always find something to lay up and sleep--an old barn, an alley, and library (she assumed that this small town had a library.

Outside, Deana began to wander around. Maybe she would run into someone who knew something about Salubrious. The only problem with a small town, she quickly discovered, was that there weren't an excessive number of people out walking around. She asked the few people that she saw, but no one knew anything. A young woman pushing a stroller even seemed to be on the verge of screaming in panic as Deana approached her. Deana, of course, didn't factor in to her actions the inborn suspicions that these people might have about outsiders.

And, as mentioned, she wasn't exactly in the most presentable state at the moment. After a day of wandering, she decided that she was going to have to find a place to sleep. She found an old park with a jungle gym that offered a nice spot to hole up. The evening air was cold and a bit damp, but it wasn't unbearable. At least she wasn't on a bus--she could hear to stars and there were no waves assaulting her. These were very real comforts to Deana at this moment.

***

The next day, Deana found herself feeling a bit more desperate about finding Salubrious. She quickly realized that wandering around this small town was not really a viable option. People were already beginning to take notice of her and wonder why she was there and what she was looking for. She had been sitting on a park bench when a police officer drove by and asked her if everything was okay. He drove off quickly after she assured him that everything was fine, but Deana had a feeling that she would see him again.

While she was there in the park, she notice a couple sitting on a blanket eating a picnic lunch under a tree. They seemed completely out of place based on what Deana has seen of Ruston so far. The man seemed to be very well dressed, for one thing. The woman was completely relaxed and didn't have the harried and harassed look that she had seen on other faces. They seemed to be living int he middle of some kind of fantasy.

Somehow their conspicuousness connected itself in Deana's mind to Salubrious. She became convinced that these people, of all people must know something about the amazing, life altering place that she had read so much about. When they seemed to be packing up and leaving, Deana gathered up her back and started to follow them. When the got into a fancy car, she stood on the sidewalk staring at them. The woman in the car pointed her out the man, who took notice of her too. 

Neither seemed panicked, but they did seem wary. The man got out fo the car and approached her. "Is there something that I can help you with?" He was tanned and athletic and just projected ease and comfort. Frankly, Deana wished that she could whisk away the woman he was with already and take her place in that car. But that wasn't likely to happen, at least not right now.

"Well, I'm looking for something."

"Oh," he said, stepped back from her a bit and shifting his weight, as if preparing for something.

"Well, there's this place. A place that I'm looking for."

"Uh huh, and what's that place called?" As he asked, he seemed to be motioning the woman from the car. She got out and stood beside him.

Deana looked at them both and wasn't sure how to respond. Why she being questioned or interrogated? Was this some kind of initiation? "I'm looking for a place called Salubrious. Do you know where it is?"

The man replied slowly, "I do, but are you sure that's why you're here."

"I'm pretty sure. I've been on a bus for days now. I'm sure."

"But are you looking for that place?" the woman interjected. "Of all the places, is that the one?" What did this mean? Deana searched through her experiences trying to figure out their angle, but nothing related or compared. 

"I need a place to stay. I'm new in town. Are you going to let me stay with you?" she said bluntly.

They both looked at her. The look obviously communicated that no, in fact, they weren't going to let her stay with her, but they seemed reluctant to carry on the conversation. "No, that's not what we mean," the man said. "I can't say that we have a place for you." Now he was being blunt too. "But if you're looking for Salubrious, then we can take you there."

"Okay, take me there then," Deana said.

Suddenly she was sitting in the back seat of this fine, fancy car. The leather seats still smelled new and had a crisp, taut feel to them. Deana could feel her dirt and grime all over herself and suddenly felt a bit embarrassed by herself. She couldn't wait to get out of the car and leave these two strange people behind. When she got to Salubrious, she would worry about her hair and clothes and making herself presentable.

***

In fact, the man and the woman did quickly disappear from her life as soon as they drove away. She didn't dwell on them for very long. When she got out of the car, she found herself standing in front of an old, dilapidated Victorian house that sat at the edge of the old neighborhood around the town square. Beyond that were a few old warehouses, train tracks, then a newer housing development that had sprung up in the fields around the town. 

Sitting on the sloped front porch was an older man slouched in a rocking chair. A young woman was sitting on the steps smoking a cigarette. Out of the front door, another man came striding out quickly. He seemed to want to throw something at the car as it pulled away, but that impulse or surge of energy was contained by incredible self-control. 

The man stopped by Deana and said, "Are you looking for Salubrious?"

"Is this it?"

Instead of answering her questions, or even looking at her, the man was still staring after the car that had already turned away and disappeared. Without looking at her, he asked, "How do you know those two?"

"I don't. I just met them today. They offered to bring me here."

"Offered? Interesting. And you are?"

"My name is Deana." She felt compelled to hold our her hand as in invitation for a hand shake, but the man did not take up her offer immediately. "I'm new here."

"You are?" He looked down at her hand, then up at her. The tone of his voice shifted subtly, "Of course, you're new and you came looking for Salubrious. How did you find out about this place?"

"A pamphlet. I've got it somewhere around here."

"No, that fine. I tell you what, you look like you could use a good shower and a rest. We'll talk later. Why don't you come inside..."

The man led her inside the house. Inside and out, the house was in disrepair. Most of the house's original wood floors had been replaced by white Formica tiles, banded by think strips of metal. Most of the original wood work existed, but had been painted in some rooms. The floor, as Deana walked across it, was mostly uneven, there were some water stains on the ceiling. Deana was surprised at first by how sub-par Salubrious really was.

But she tried to suspend judgment until she learned more. Maybe, she thought, there are actually two Salubrious in town--maybe this is the low income or assisted facility. She quickly learned that this was not the case. No, in fact, this was the one and only Salubrious. In the meantime, the man led up her the main staircase that stretched up the fourth floor fo the house, which was really notice more than he very top most part of the attic that had been framed in as sleeping space.

"You'll be up here. Quarters are a little tight right now. Why don't you set your stuff down. Showers are on the 2nd floor. Come find me when you're done."

Deana felt somewhat on her guard and didn't just leave her stuff up here. She could have just holed up up here and not left. The thought of taking a shower,  however, was too powerful. She gathered a few things together and proceeded downstairs. Fortunately for her the shower was working and the hot water seemed to be plentiful.

Deana enjoyed her shower, so much so that the bathroom air became think with steam. At first, she didn't notice it, but when she pulled back the curtain to dry her eyes, she noticed how steamy the bathroom was at that moment. She also didn't notice a man crouched down in the room beside her things, going through them. It wasn't until she drew back the shower curtain before shutting off the water that she noticed him and screamed, reaching down for a towel to cover herself.

The man, who was much more haggard looking than the other man, stood up against the wall and started to giggle. It was a strange response, but that's what he didn't. Deana, still wrapped in a towel, crouched down and didn't notice anything missing. "Why are you laughing?" she asked. "what are you doing?"

"It's a hobby of mine." he said.

"What, barging into people's baths and taking stuff from them.

"Oh no no. I wasn't stealing from you. I have hoping to learn a little bit more abot you. I"m a little bit psychic. Living here, however, I have become much more psychic. Do you want me to read your stuff? i can do that, you know."

"tell you what," she replied. "how about I get dressed then come find you." 

"We'll that' s a thought," the man replied.

***

Later when Deana went to find the other man, he was sitting in the yard behind the house at a picnic table smoking cigarettes. He also had a plastic cup with wine and was sipping at it slowly. "So, what is your trick?" she asked him.

"Give me something of yours--keys, a wallet, your watch." Again, she looked at him with a generous amount of skepticism. "I'm not going to steal. Why do people always assume that I'm going to steal from them. Look at this place. What do I need? Everything is provided for me here," he said.

Deana handed him the thin remnants of her wallet. He held the wallet to his face and closed his eyes. "You're very troubled. I can tell. Very dark things behind you...I'm not sure that the doctor will be happy to have you here. I would watch myself if I were you." He handed her the wallet back. What was she supposed to make of this advice coming from a scrawny, grizzled, drunk who claimed to be a psychic? Sadly, this was very good advice for someone like her, but the messenger tainted the message.

They sat for a few more minutes before she asked him, "Do you like living here?"

"Here? It's a place. My head doesn't bother me, at least when I'm not hung over..." he started giggling and sputtering over this comment. "I mean, I can keep my head together just fine here." He leaned into her, "The waves don't bother me anymore." 

At least this was something. Deana started to tell her about her long bus trip to get here and the difficulties she had finding Salubrious. As she told the story, though this man, who said that his name was Henry, kept getting details confused and switched around. He would latch on to some insignificant detail--say about a man sitting across from her that she noticed. Suddenly, in his mind, she was related to this person and trying to run away from him. Everything became a subtext, an insinuation. PRetty soon, Deana wasn't sure what story she was trying to tell.

For her part, she got hung up on the details of trying to find this place and how difficult it was. "I really think someone needs to make it clearer how to find this place. I could have been wandering around for days before I found it. Even a sign could have helped."

"We have to be careful, you know. Signs? People will find us, that's what I think." This wasn't Henry, but the man she met before. "I'm Dr. Conroy. And you are?"

"Her name is Deana. I'd watch out for her. She's trouble," Henry interjected. "I checked her things already too. She's clean."

The doctor looked a little embarrassed by the disclosure of this information, but only a little. "We have to take precautions around here," he said.

"So that's what you were doing looking through my things?" She said. "What did you think I was wired or something? How do I know that I can trust you? I mean, you can't even print decent directions on your brochures."

"She's right, you know," Henry said, nodding all the way through a swig of his wine.

"Henry, I thought that I asked you to stop drinking on the grounds." Deana quickly learned that "the grounds" was the name that the doctor gave to  Salubrious. "Would you mind throwing it away please? And you, Deana? Why don't we take a walk."

Henry slouched back inside, grunting at few of the other residents who were milling around. Deana didn't quite have a handle yet on who was here and what they were doing. When the back door shut behind Henry, the doctor turned to her and said, "Okay, let's take that walk."

As they did, the doctor got most of the details about the last few years of her life out of her. Deana found herself divulging much of what had made up her inner and outer life during that time. She even confessed to him that she had burned down her "chamber," as she called it. "Maybe it burned down the house too. The whole neighborhood? I don't know."

"You left town before you could find out."

"Before anyone could find out, just my neighbor knew."

"Your neighbor?"

"He helped me burn it down. And he drove me to the bus station to get here."

"So, he knew about your plans to come here?"

"Oh, sure. We were high as a kite that night. I told him everything. Well, him and his girlfriend and her mother. And these two kids in his basement too."

The doctor seemed very unruffled by this news, didn't even blink about it, but he did ask her a few more questions about her neighbor including, "Well, what should I tell him if he comes looking for you or calls for you?"

"Oh, he won't. He'll forget all about me, I bet."

"Well, let's say that he does. What should I tell him?"

"You probably need to worry more about my brother?"

"And why is that?"

"For one, he's a real asshole. That's why." Deana started laughing.

"Why are laughing?"

"I've never called my brother an asshole before. It feels good."

"Is he an asshole?"

"Probably. I think so. He was never given a damn about me his whole life. So, he's been an asshole to me. He "let" me live in our father's house. But who was he to tell me whether or not I could wherever I wanted to. That's the kind of person he is. Thinks he invents the rule for just about everyone around him. Do the rules apply to him? Oh, no, of course not. He's had three wives and kids all over the place and has lost jobs over being an idiot. But, he comes down hard on me. I can't believe I'm telling you all of this."

"It feels good, though, doesn't it?"

"It does."

"Well, welcome to Salubrious. That's what I'm trying to do here. Take people like you who are used to only one thing--feeling terrible day in and day out and make you feel better. This place, the radio free zone is amazing and I want to share it with people."

"I'm glad that I'm here."

"But Deana, Deana, stop for a minute." They had been walking down an old dirt road surrounded by trees for sometime. Deana really hadn't been paying attention to where they were or where they were going. She had just been talking and talking about her life to the doctor. So, here they were in the middle of nowhere, when the doctor stopped and changed his tone. "Deana, I have to know that you are bringing bad things with you to this place. I have to protect us, everyone here. If you are going to live here, then you have to promise me that you will do what you can to protect this place to."

"I'll try."

"Now, I don't mean to sound paranoid, but there are people that want to close down Salubrious, that don't want people to find us and to feel better, to participate in the magic of this place. Does that sound strange?"

Deana thought back through all the instances of people trying to deny her things that she wanted. She recalled all of the slights and injuries that others had caused her. She had never found consolation for these injuries. This place seemed to offer these things. It didn't seem strange at all, then, that people might want to take it from her. "No, I can see that. That makes sense to me."

"Good, I feel better about that already. Let's head back for dinner."


## MEETING THE FIRST REFUGEE

When she first arrived in Ruston, Martha stayed in a small hotel at the center of town. She sat in the even smaller room looking out of the window, watching people meandering on the sidewalk, watching an occasional car pass by, getting a feel for the pace of life in this new place. The pace certainly was different from the city. Everyone and everything moved so much slower here.

It also took her some time to get used to not seeing a proliferation of electronic devices. People did not have their faces buried in smart phones. Televisions and radio were not constantly blaring around her. She started taking walks in the evening, and enjoyed it too. She would talk casually with people who passed by, acting as if she had lived there all her life. 

The effects of being in Ruston on her were quick and apparent. She rarely dreaded getting up in the morning, hardly needed coffee or alcohol to regulate her mood throughout the day. She had even forgotten about her regular rounds of meditation, of fancy herbal concoctions, and of aura cleanings. Everything about her that was tarnished and dull seemed to be polished and shined by the clean, radio free air around her.

After her first month being in Ruston, however, Martha decided that it was time to figure out more permanent plans for settlement. One night in the hotel restaurant, she had met a man named Nick who claimed to be a doctor. He was charming enough and easy to talk to at least for Martha. He pulled her, somewhat reluctantly, into a conversation about mystical and esoteric things. Maybe it started with a passing comment about energy or crystals or something.

It didn't take long, however, for them both to understand why they were there--to relish the peace and quiet of the radio free zone. The doctor, Dr. Conroy, to be precise, told her about his "clinic," at at least that was the term he used with her. It was located just a mile or so down the main street through Ruston. He invited her to come by and to have a look around.

Martha wasn't exactly sure how to interpret the invitation. She sensed some degree of flirtation in the doctor's behavior, but she couldn't be sure. He was intensely personal, and extremely emotional with her--all things that she was unused to having been with Greg. The doctor's intense manner and way of talking certainly felt like the more sincere and intimate type of flirtation. And why wouldn't he flirt with her, she thought. She was young enough, particularly for this place that seemed to house only the middle-aged and elderly. 

Greg didn't really factor into her perceptions of the appropriateness of her or the doctor's behavior. And, frankly, why should it have? At that moment, Greg was asleep--nothing more to report. By the end fo the night, Martha had decided to see this operation's of the doctor's, to find this place that he called "Salubrious," and to see where things took her. After all, in trying to purify herself of all the sickening waves and signals around her on a day to day basis, clearly the intended goal was to experience more of life.

She walked to find Salubrious the next morning and got lost on the way. It wasn't really that she got lost, as much as Salubrious lost her. She stood in front of the ramshackle, decrepit Victorian house for quite some time before deciding that this must be the place. She was put on guard, but seeing the smiling doctor emerge on the front porch alleviated her concerns.

"I'm so happy you made it," he said. "Let me show you around."

He explained that he only had a few people under his care and talked extensively about his "patients" Much like with his use of the word "clinic" he was very deliberate about this word choice. He took her to the room of an older woman who was sitting and reading a book by the window. "She hasn't been able to sit and read for years," he said.

They went upstairs and found a heavy set man who looked to be in his mid-thirties playing cards in a common area. "We try to give people a sense of community. That's my goal anyway."

"How many people are living here right now?" she asked.

"Well, including myself only five, but I think that we could grow and expand. I want to offer some very inventive services to help people. I am very interested in studying the effects of being in the radio free zone on these people."

Martha innocently asked, "Do you have a lab somewhere?"

The doctor paused for a moment, his eyes rolling up then back down, "This is my lab," he replied and started to move on. That seemed like a reasonable enough answer to Martha and she continued on with him.

By the end of her tour, Martha still felt that the house was shabby, but she has seen a glimpse of the whole vision, of the doctor's plan and felt inspired by it. "I want to be a part of this," she told him before she left. The doctor outlined several ways that she would help. But, she explained that she would have to think about it first. "Give me a few days," she said, "this is s a big decision.

***

Around this time, an unusual visitor was passing through Ruston. A traveling performer would appear in the town's theater in two nights. He billed himself as a magician and clairvoyant. But, perhaps most of all, he performed with a traveling companion, a parakeet named Victor. While the performer was world renowned for his predictions and prognostications, the bird was the real star of the show.

An article appeared in the local paper that detailed a chilling prediction that the bird, Victor, had made during the previous show. Towards the end of the show, the performer, Hugo Santorini, asked the bird, Victor, about his future. "'Tell me, Victor, what lies ahead for you?'" he asked and the paper reported.

The bird, who spoke in a voice that sounded like a speed up voice on a tape recorder, responded, "Well, I haven't seen you in a while. I will die in two weeks." The audience, who had laughed and cried at the antics of this bright green bird gasped. One person reported that Mr. Santorini, the performer, seemed shocked and genuinely surprised by this pronouncement. When asked about it after the show, he merely said, "The bird sees strange things some times."

The next step on their tour was Ruston and people wondered if the bird would indeed die. The question of the show and the bird's imminent demise raised ethical questions for many people. These questions focused both on themselves and on the performer, Hugo Santorini. Was it really right to attend a show knowing that the lead performer would likely die in the midst of it? Despite the macabre tenor of this question and the disturbing implications of the ethical problem, the show was sold out.

The theater's owner, of course, was thrilled. He had tried to revive the town's old theater and poured thousands and thousands of dollars into it. Every kind of restaurant and attraction had passed through the main floor. The ice cream parlor that currently resided there had managed to stay afloat for some time. Movies were shown, then not shown. Performers performed and then didn't perform. Running a business in an environment like that was very difficult.

So, ethical questions didn't really factor in his very public press conference to go ahead with the show. He stood in front of his theater, held up the article and said, "The people deserve to know." Everyone took this assertion of their rights at face value and more or less agreed with him. They did deserve to know--in a word where things deserved and undeserved were doled out in an inconsistent and chaotic manner here was the opportunity to assert their merit and to seize the opportunity to know.

Even though he was in town, no one saw Hugo Santorini around town at all. He did not appear in any diner, or post card shops. No one knew where he was. Children had tried to break into the small RV that he toured in, but were scared off by a few clattering trash cans in the alley. People were on the look out and they were disappointed.

But this only served to raise the anticipation for the show. The newspaper had wrangled a commitment from most of the city leaders to attend. The mayor would attend and make a speech before the show. He did not like the theater owner very well because they had competed for a school board seat many years ago and the wounds had cut deep. But, for the sake of his image, he decided to indeed give a speech that night. The other council members, the chief of police, and the members of all of the social clubs in town would attend. 

The morning of the show, Martha was asleep in her small hotel room, which was a few doors down from the theater when she heard a knock on her door. She got up quickly and threw some clothes on. When she answered the door, she saw the smiling face of Dr. Conroy looking back at her. "Dr. Conroy?"

"Martha, hello."

"Doctor what are you doing here? How do you know where I was staying."

"Well, Ruston is a small place. It didn't take long to figure out."

This was a very obvious fact that Martha had not really considered before now. There might be many people in town who were intimately acquainted with her comings and goings without her even realizing it. She had been so used to living in a world of impersonal bustle and business that this revelation was a strange one to her.

"I guess that makes sense. Do you want to come in?" she asked, trying to be polite in the midst of this strange and somewhat awkward situation.

"Yes, if you don't mind. I have a proposition, I mean a proposal to make." The doctor seemed very nervous, fumbling over his words this way. Martha smiled and took it in stride. She was not a great beauty and had never considered herself to be very attractive. But she liked the attention that the doctor seemed to give her. He acknowledged some kind of power that she had over him that she had never really understood or utilized before. It was a development worth exploring in greater depth at some point.

"And what is your proposition, doctor? If it's about Salubrious, I still can't make up my mind."

"Oh, what? That? No, no, take all the time you need or have. No, it's about tonight."

"Tonight?"

"Yes, were you planning...thinking about going to the show tonight?"

"You mean with this magician and his bird? I hadn't really thought about it. I just read about it yesterday. There aren't any tickets are there?"

"Well, no, there aren't. I mean to say that the show is sold out. I have tickets though. I acquired them. But that's not all. The tickets aren't really the issue."

"What is the issue?"

"Not an issue, just not what I cam to ask you about. I wanted to ask...well, do you want to meet Hugo Santorini?"

Because she was no new to Ruston and still orienting herself to this new life, she wasn't properly caught up in the excitement over the great performer and his bird. Given her predliction for the mystical and metaphysical, she found her curiosity piqued, but her curiosity wasn't conditioned by boredom or other, more desperate, social pathologies.

"Meet him? But no one has even seen him. People don't even believe that he's real, do they?"

"No, he's real."

"You've met him?"

"Yes, I've met him. I know him. He and I know each other."

"Really!? And the bird, what about the bird?" Whereas the general social hubbub hadn't caught MArtha, this invitation to experience something exclusive and rare did. The thought that she would have privileged access to some piece of knowledge, or to experience something that no one else had, was simply too much to resist.

"Sure, I'm interested."

"In that case, you need to get dressed and meet me downstairs in an hour." 

"And what will you do?"

"Don't worry about that, just be downstairs in an hour sharp. Don't be late."

Martha got ready quickly. She pushed from her mind the potentially concerning thought that she was essentially going on a date with his man, this doctor, whoever he might be. Perhaps because of her experiences with aura cleansing and meditation retreats, her sensitivity to eccentrics was probably less pronounced than it might be for others. At that moment, she was happy to go along with him on whatever strange experience he was offering.

***

When she appeared downstairs, the doctor was sitting in a car reading a newspaper. He folded up the paper quickly and got out of the car. "Okay," he said, "Are you ready?"

They walked around to the back of the theater and knocked door with the window painted out black covered with bars. The doctor knocked again and then kicked at the door. The door opened quickly and the doctor and Martha slipped inside. The theater owner shut the door behind them saying, "I don't like this at all."Martha turned back to smile at him, but he was already disappeared. 

As they worked their way through the back stage area, weaving around dirty old crates and crumbled beams of metal, they passed through a door and were standing in the old orchestra pit staring up at a man on stage wearing only trousers and a dirty undershirt. "Hugo, this is her," the doctor said to him.

"The lady?" the magician replied. He was standing with his arms out, flexing at the wait. Then he held his arm up and a whirl of green settled into the shape a bird perched on his hand. Hugo walked to the edge of the stage and sat down. "This is Victor. Say hello Victor."

"Heh-lo" the bird replied. It spoke at a rapid clip. The words were hard to understand for Martha. She wondered if the bird were really speaking at all. Yet she felt that she understood something that it was communicating. The bird blinked, twisted its head, and look around. Then it looked at her. Maybe because she had read about its prophecy, Martha felt that the bird seemed haunted and sad. She felt bad for the tragic parakeet and wondered if it really would die tonight.

The doctor turned to Martha and said, "Hugo has a favor to ask. He reached out to me first. He needs someone to help him with tonight's show."

"And you're asking me?"

"well, that was my first thought," the doctor said. You seemed like the right person to do it."

"Do what exactly?"

Hugo kicked his legs against the stage. Despite his somewhat corpulent body and grizzled short, he looked like a little boy sitting there petting the bright green bird walking over his hand. "I just need a pretty lady to ask Victor some questions. The doctor said that he knew a pretty lady."

The doctor looked embarrassed. "That's not exactly how he put it. But, I suggested you."

"But what would I be doing."

"You'll be up on stage. I want you to ask Victor about your future. Then ask him why he thinks he's going to die." The bird just blinked, squeaked, and flapped its wings at the mention of its death.

"Okay, I'll do it," Martha said. They stayed and talked with Hugo Santorini for a little while longer. The theater owner hovered in back stage, seemingly nervous about this star attraction being so distracted. Finally he stepped on stage and said, "Mr. Santorini, I'd like to finish setting up the lights if you don't mind. If I had a crew, it wouldn't matter, but I don't." The theater owner was always commenting on this thing or that would have been done much more efficiently if he only had a crew. Alas, he did not have one, and had to perform a number of menial jobs tonight. 

When they left the theater, the sun seemed much brighter than before. Martha's eyes adjusted by the time they returned to her hotel room. "I'll see you tonight?" the doctor asked.

"Yes, of course. I'm...looking forward to it."

***

The street around the theater that night was filling up with people. The police had blocked the street. People flowed from the street into the park around the courthouse in the town square. Everyone was dressed in their best clothes. Reporters wandered around talking and interviewing people. In the midst of it all, the theater owner seemed everywhere, talking to everyone.

Martha wandered in the crowd, looking for the doctor. She had insisted on meeting him in front of the theater, instead of having him come up to her room. Only Martha couldn't find the doctor now amidst all of the people. After wandering in and out of the center of the crowd, she hung back on the edge, shifting this way and that to let people pass through and find the people they were meeting.

She felt someone behind and turned quickly thinking it was the doctor. She turned with a degree of enthusiasm that surprised her. She hadn't realized that she was looking forward to seeing him again. Only when she turned, it wasn't the doctor standing behind her. An older man stood in the place where the doctor was supposed to be. He had graying hair, a mustache, but was dressed very nicely, much nicer than many of the people around him. How could Martha tell? His collar was crisp and white. His tie was perfectly tied and shimmered in the evening light. He smelled like spicy cologne too.

Martha looked at him and said, "I'm sorry."

He replied with a flirtatious but unassuming, "I'm not. My name is Anthony."

"I'm Martha."

"I haven't seen you around town."

"I just moved here."

This man grew a bit more serious looking when Martha said this. "Really, you just moved here?"

"Yes, about a month ago."

"I don't mean to be forward, but I can ask you why?"

Before she could answer, the doctor has tugging at her elbow, somewhat more forcefully than she would have liked. "Martha, I've been looking for you." Again, the possessiveness in her voice rankled her. She wanted to turn back to the dashing man standing in front of her who, in spite of his somewhat awkward question, seemed much more appealing to Martha then.

"Well, a discussion for another time. Nice to meet you. Doctor..." The man nodded at Dr. Conroy as he passed by and slipped into the crowd. Soon he was swarmed and swallowed up by the core of crowd where the mayor and other local luminaries were standing and talking.

Martha refocused on the doctor, "You know each other?'

"Only in passing."

Martha wanted to comment on how the doctor seem to know a variety of interesting people, some very surprising people, but she kept the comment to herself. She wasn't feeling as sanguine about the doctor as she had before. The doctor seemed to detect that he was navigating into treacherous terrain and was able to course correct quickly. He loosed his grip on her elbow, gave her arm a gentle pat and returned his hands to himself. He held out his crooked arm though and said, "Should we find our seats."

The seats that he had for the show were not nearly as good as Martha would have thought for someone as closely connected to the performer as he was. The man she had just met, Anthony he had said, however, was sitting in the first rows of the theater. He continually got up to escort little ladies to their seat and was fussed over by many of the people around him.

Martha tried to not let too much of her attention fall on him, but could feel her gaze pull back to him over and over again. The doctor certainly did a good job pretending to not notice. Maybe he was being torn up inside over her wandering looks; Martha couldn't tell. As the they sat waiting for the show to begin, the doctor asked roundabout questions about her past. Martha was able to dodge most of them fairly successfully. She didn't hint that she had been in a serious relationship, that she had all but abandoned a perfectly fine job, that she had left a whole life behind to move here.

They did talk a little bit about the radio free zone. Martha had noticed though that people rarely spoke openly about it. The doctor seemed even more circumspect about it for some reason. He didn't address her mysterious illness at all during their time together, especially now that people were around. Martha didn't mind this at all though. It was as if the radio waves and frequencies weren't the things destroying her life at all. Rather it was the interference caused by her life itself that had made her sick. She just finally had the guts to hit the reset button and start over.

But none of this was spoken between them at all. Maybe they both implicitly understood it; maybe not. Before they had to worry over it, though, the house lights were dimming and the theater owner came on stage.

"Ladies and gentleman, I'm so pleased to see you all here tonight. As you know this theater has been a mainstay in this community for over a hundred years. Great performers from the past have passed through and sang and acted and entertained. But we aren't here to enjoy a play or listen to music. We are here to be amazed by a very rare and uncommon performer, and I'm not just talking about the bird named Victor." People laughed pleasantly at this; a light ripple of claps spread through the audience. Martha looked around and smiled at the smiles around her.

"I have had the privilege of spending some time with Mr. Santorini, and yes, his amazing bird, Victor. But don't worry, he did not reveal his secrets to me, no matter how hard I tried." More pleasant laughter. "But before the show begins, I am honored to bring out our esteemed mayor on this stage. It is fitting that the mayor should say a few words tonight. He guards his secrets even more closely than Mr. Santorini!" People clapped heartily now as the mayor walked on stage.

The mayor thanked the theater owner and recalled the last time that he spoke on this stage during the dedication ceremony the night the theater reopened. "I think it is fair to say that we were filled with hope that night. I think that we won't be disappointed tonight," he said. Whether this was meant as a sincere and simple statement of fact, or an underhanded dig cannot be said for sure. Either way, the mayor cleared off the stage, leaving it empty for Mr. Santorini.

The spot light on the stage went dark. Only the dim exit lighting from the aisles lit the theater up with a ghostly glow. Martha could heard footsteps, then a squeaking fast voice say, "The show is beginning." The lights came up and people applauded at the sigh of Hugo Santorini and his bird, Victor.

MArtha was impressed by how much more impressive the man seemed on stage now. He obviously had makeup on that made his face look more dramatic. But he seemed imbued with a presence and authority that were not evident when he was kicking the sides of the stage. The first half of the show consisted mostly of the magician performed pleasant parlor tricks--guessing cards, making objects disappear, and the like. He had early on pointed out a young boy--the Mayor's son, it turned out--to Victor and instructed Victor to watch the show from the boy's shoulder. Victor flapped out over the audience and landed on the boy's hand. This moment hadn't been rehearsed, as far as MArtha knew, and it pleased the audience immensely. 

Soon enough Martha realized that a smaller spotlight from the girders above the stage was trained on her. She shielded her eyes and looked up and just make out the theater owner dressed in his nice suit operating the light, cursing under his breath about not having any help. With the light on her, she was standing up and making her way to the stage.

At the steps leading up to the stage, the man from earlier, Anthony, stood up and offered his hand to help her up on stage. People seemed very pleased by this for some reason as a ripple of whispers and titters fanned out through the audience. Standing next to Hugo, Martha felt like she could see the man again. He was sweating at the temples and she could see the makeup cracking around his mouth and around his eyes.

"Good evening young lady. You and I have never met before, have we?"

"No, we haven't."

"And you haven't met my good friend Victor, either, have you?"

"No, we haven't met yet either."

"Very good. Now, I know that there are skeptics among us. The world is overrun with skeptics and unbelievers. now, I am not speaking in a religious sense. I mean in a plain, everyday sense. But I want your help. I need your help to prove to these people that belief is real. That this bird is real. That we can see and know the future."

These were all very grand pronouncements being made by Hugo, the magician. Martha didn't quite realize that she was signing on to battle the modern world's love affair with unbelief. But here she was, standing on stage next to a bright green bird who could tell the future. Who was she to not believe at this point?

Victor had flown back to Hugo's hand and sitting on his shoulder now. Hugo extended his arm and twisted at the waist--the same gesture he had made earlier that day. He moved his arm out in front, bringing victor eye level with her. "Hold out your hand," he said. Martha held out her hand and felt the bird's craggy claws scale her finger and arms. It perched on her elbow as she kept her arm aloft awkwardly. It walked back down to her hand and rested there.

"Victor, Victor, this is Martha. Say hello"

"Heh-lo Marth-a"

Victor, Martha has a question for you. Are you ready for the question."

"She can tell me her question."

"Go ahead now."

Martha paused. She looked out at the large audience in the theater and felt overwhelmed by the faces starting at her. It amazed her that the magician seemed to take no notice of them at all, and yet was completely in tune with their every shift in attention. She composed herself and started to speak, "Vic...Victor...Victor, what is my future?"

"You are going to marry a man in this theater."

"Ha, ha!" Hugo laughed. "Victor is a romantic. Are you married?"

"No, I'm not."

"Well, then, I count that as a victory! Victor, tell MArtha something about her past."

The bird looked back at him then at her. "Greg misses you," it said and squacked.

Martha didn't expect to hear this.

"He want you to come home."

The audience was completely silent, enraptured by what they were hearing.

"And Victor, who is Greg?" the magician asked. The bird wouldn't respond now. It sat there silently then suddenly said, "You shouldn't have come here."

The bird then dipped down and snapped at Martha's hand. She started to bleed and pulled her hand back. The bird, suspended in mid air, was flapping it wings and trying to attack her. Martha waved her hands violently at the bird. Victor then flew up into the theater. Everyone was talking loudly now. Hugo Santorini looked confused and annoyed. 

Martha's hand had bleeding badly now and she had scratches on her face. The man named Anthony had rushed up on stage and was trying to stop the bleeding. As he and Martha stood there, the theater owner started yelling, "Get this bird under control! Get it away from me." He started the flail around then fell from the catwalk where he was standing. 

In his desperation to break his fall, he tried to grab onto a bank of stage lights, but only managed to pull the lights down with him. The lights hit the stage and burst into flames. The flames caught on the stage curtains. People began screaming and emptying the theater. A few people had rushed on the stage to try to contain the fire, but there was nothing they could do.

People were streaming onto the street, making it difficult for the fire trucks to position themselves in front of the theater. Plumes of smoke began wafting from the theater. Police officers arrived on the scene and began pushing the crowd back into the park.

Martha lost track of events as soon as the theater owner fell. Anthony must have whisked her outside because she gathered her wits again laying on a bed in a large bedroom somewhere she didn't recognize. She went into the bathroom adjoining the room and washed her face. Her hand was bandaged, but throbbed with pain. She went back and lay down on the bed. Laying there she realized that it had been a while since she slept in a really nice bed. The firm mattress lulled her into a very deep sleep.


## THE CALL FROM INSIDE THE BAR

For the next month or so, Jason got back on track with his work. He was alert while working in the lab, got his reports done, on time. He only had a looming event on the horizon to deal with at this point, which was a presentation to give in front of some of the senior researchers at the lab. He would have to present his findings and make a compelling case about why his time there so far had been well-spent. 

At this point, Jason felt like he had reams of data, lots of numbers, but very little in the way of a cohesive claim about those numbers. He could prove that he had done work, but probably not what the work meant. 

The pressure to produce tangible results, however, had not lessened since his heart to heart with Dr. Dorian. If anything, things had gotten worse for him. He felt like he had tainted the well of good feelings towards him by drawing from it already. Could you really go back to the doctor again and say, "Hey, I'm failing and your help before didn't work, so can you help me again?" That seemed very unlikely to 


***

[Interjection: Changing up things a little bit with the Jason character based on Christine's feedback. I am going to run with her idea that Jason could have been taken on to work on a specific project, only it turns out that the instrument he needs is completely broken and has been for some time. His main prof isn't around much and all of the other post-docs are working on more high-profile projects.]

When he got back to the lab after his time away, Jason tried to find Marco once and for all. He was still convinced that if he could get Marco and Dane in a room together, he could figure out how to fix his telescope and start working on his project. Maybe it was surviving his near brush with death--at least that was what he was calling it now--but Jason did proceed down the halls with renewed sense of purpose, even confidence. He felt people taking notice of him for the first time in a while. He returned a few nods and waves before proceeding down several flights of stairs to the office area. 

As he had for the past several months, Jason wandered in and out of the cubicles and small offices looking for Marco. He started to wonder if he really had met the elusive Marco. Yet he felt like he still retained an image of his colleagues skinny, narrow face and sandy hair. After an hour of looking like this, Jason's new found confidence began to wear off. He proceeded to sit down at his own desk and close his eyes for a few minutes.

As was often the case, a few minutes became a few hours. What finally woke him up was a ringing telephone a few cubicles down from him. The ringing persisted for a surprising length of time, stopped, started up again, then finally stopped. Perhaps if Jason had been a crack cryptographer then he might have been able to decode any secret messages contained in the sequences of rings, or might have even thought to look. But since he was not, he did not.

Jason grabbed his things and decided to leave the lab and go home, or ride his bike for a while, or do something. As he left the office area another post-doc working on a different project and with a different advisor stopped him and said, "Having problems?"

"No, not too many, thanks."

"Well, I warned them not to bring on anyone to work with that equipment. No one has taken care of it. Not that anyone listens to me."

"That's too bad. If only they had..." Jason said blankly.

"If only they had. Oh well..." The conversation ended there.

Comments like these were part of the intricate psychological game that one had to engage in to survive situations like these. This student, whether knowingly or not, planted deep seeds of annoyance and irritation inside Jason. This kind of fidgety rage was the very think that would probably derail his work for several days. There was only so much he could do with the small samples of data he had from early on during his research project. 

Jason tried to realize, though, that this student was also just laying down his own terrain and claim over Jason's neck of the woods, in whatever way possible. Even with passing remarks like this (and this clearly wasn't the first), the student tried to assert some higher level of perspective and understanding on poor Jason's very own experience and knowledge.

So, Jason didn't let the comment unsettle him that much, and certainly didn't feel that this was a prelude to his final downfall. Since he couldn't find Marco, maybe he would try Dane again. After all, hadn't he spent the last few months acting like a ping-pong ball in exactly this way.

In the shop, Dane was welding something and had his huge visor down over his face. The bulky man killed his torch and lifted his visor, "What are you doing around here?" he asked gruffly.

"Just curious how things were going. Just checking in."

"Check in on me!?" Jason had a way of always saying the wrong thing around Dane. Jason blamed it on the vaguely European lilt in Dane's voice, but couldn't be sure.

"Well, I was...just curious what you're up to. What you're working on."

"I'm repairing a platform for one of the teams. The welds were weakening."

"That's too bad."

"Uh, yeah. Look, I'm going to get back to my work."

"Oh, sure...."

And with that his conversation with Dane ended. Jason drifted out of the shop finally resigning himself to having failed for another day to do what he had set out to do. He went out to retrieve his bike. As he unlocked his bike, he noticed someone in a car in the parking lot watching him. He couldn't quite tell but it appeared to be a woman, maybe the woman from the cabin the other day.

Jason had no idea what to make of this and was even more confused when the woman got out of the car and proved to, in fact, be her. She crossed the parking lot towards him. In a very movie like way, she was wrapped in in a trench coat, wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses. She removed the sunglasses and said, "I feel terrible about the other day."

"Okay, it was not a big deal, I guess," Jason replied.

"No, it was awful and got me thinking about things."

"What kind of things?" Jason screamed at himself internally. Why was he asking her this? Was he crazy?

"I just suddenly realized that my life had become something strange. I didn't recognize it anymore. I don't know what I'm doing here."

"At the lab?"

"No, in Ruston, in the radio quiet zone. This is the lab?" She seemed to be aware of her surroundings for the first time.

"Yeah, it is."

"Must be exciting."

"I guess."

"What do you do?"

Was this the kind of lead in that a spy would use, he wondered. Was he being entrapped by someone or something? Maybe Dr. Dorian was testing him. Jason realized how paranoid and crazy these thoughts were and yet it was from the same place that these thoughts originated. Injected the crazy thoughts and throttling them back at the same time was probably exactly the kind of thing that ones unconscious mind should be doing.

"I'm a post-doc here. A researcher."

"How interesting. It must be exciting. I used to work at a university, actually. Before I came here."

"Oh..."

"Yeah, back in Chicago. Where I lived before now."

Over her shoulder, Jason saw a golden yellow pickup truck pull up behind the car that the woman was sitting in. He immediately recognized the man in the white cowboy hat behind the steering wheel. In what already seemed like a characteristic gesture, the man leaned over to the passenger window to get a good look at them and tipped his hat at him.

The woman turned back too and saw the truck, "I can't believe he sent that thug to follow me."

"Thug?"

"Don't get me started on that man." 

Jason didn't intend to. He hoisted himself up on his bike and sped off down the path that led back to town. He looked over at his shoulder back at the woman who was watching him as he rode away. He really didn't know what she wanted from him. It was strange because no part of the interaction felt like flirtation. She wasn't coming on to him in the usual sense. He felt like some kind of window that was being propped open against the natural tendencies of a window to close. 

She was struggling to keep that window open and the struggle was palpable to him. Perhaps it was his obvious, manifest effort that made him most uncomfortable. It was like being handed someones feeling molded in a ball and being told to watch over it and care for it. What business was it of his to guard those feelings for her? He had his own problems to deal with.

***

Jason convinced his wife to let him meet some of the other post-docs at the bar that night. She agreed to put the baby down for bed since he was home to fix dinner and wash the dishes. They had a pleasant evening together and everyone left feeling generally satisfied with the flow of giving and taking that took place. 

He rarely ventured out with the other students since it was the single ones who most often lingered at the bars and social events. There was one other student who was a "non-traditional" student, married, but had older kids and could drink almost any of them under the table. The conversation between the 7 or 8 of them was always a little stiff until it went off the rails. At that point they were all more or less acting and it didn't really matter what or who they were. 

Whenever Jason arrived at events like these, he always saw a look of surprise and pity in the others faces. Two of the students had landed the rare combination of working for a star researchers who was generally a decent human being. The others did not work for decent human beings, but at least had interesting and well-funded projects to work on. They all proceeded with a sense that whatever they did--everything they did--would contribute to bettering their careers. 

They all seemed to understand that JAson had been handed a pile of half-formed puzzle pieces and asked to proceed like the rest. They all acknowledged that fate and chance had set up this unfortunate situation for him, and were mostly relieved that they weren't the ones facing such an onerous and bleak task. Indeed, with the pieces that Jason was working with, they all knew that he wouldn't last long and wondered when the last event he would show up would be.

The bar they met at, called Stockmans, was a kind of mock-Western bar. Probably at one point it had been a real hill billy honky-tonk club, but a few wobbly tables occupied by even wobblier patrons had filled up the tiny stage in the back. Now the bar just had the faded aura of those days. The students congregated there mostly to drink inexpensive beer in dark brown booths each one "branded" on the side with a fancy S and M and cattle rustling regalia.

One of the post-docs, an Indian student named Dipesh, was in rare form that night. He was argumentative and loud, which was somewhat out of character. He managed to be just funny enough that the other students tolerated his exaggerated accounts of his run-ins with the shop techs and the office staff. 

Jason laughed along with the rest and prodded Dipesh along to amplify the absurdities of the stories he was telling. The waitress came by, a local girl in her early twenties, and tapped him on the shoulder. "Oh, I'm okay for now."

"You have a phone call..."

"Really, where?"

"On the phone, at the bar," she said.

"Okay, can I take it?"

"Yeah, sure. It's sitting there for you."

Jason got up and went to the bar. He picked up the phone. Before he could say anything, the person on the other end said, "I have a proposition for you. But you have to agree to a few terms."

"Who is this?"

"It doesn't matter. You'll figure it out soon enough."

"Why are you calling me here?"

"I'm keeping an eye on you. I want to make sure you don't get into any real trouble."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I see you getting a little out of control with your friends. I don't like to see people get out of control of themselves, you see."

Jason felt unsettled by this. someone was watching him. Where was the person? Had they followed him home? Was someone at his house now?

"I can see your upset. It's okay, you'll figure it out soon enough, keep looking around."

Jason scanned the bar over and over again. The honky-tonk gloom that softened the edges of the hard people inside also made it difficult to really identify anyone. Finally his eye settled an old battered pay phone at the back of the bar. It was still operational; he had even called his wife from it once when he was really drunk. Peeking of the top of the pay phone's enclosure was the peak of a white hat.

Why the man in the white hat was in the bar calling him from a pay phone, he had no idea. The hat didn't move. The man didn't peer around the side and acknowledge him. That little crest of white just sat there, staring back at him like the steely whites of an eye. "What do you want?"

"I'm going to help you out a little in exchange for helping me out."

"What kind of help can you give me?"

"I would think that someone in your position wouldn't really be asking that question? Seems to me that any help would be welcome."

"Help with what exactly?"

"Your work; your project; your future."

"All that, huh?"

"Tone it down, kid. But, yeah, all of that."

"What are you going to do?"

"My employer is going to make a generous donation to the lab. That donation will be reserved for your project. Meanwhile, I make sure that you get the help and attention that you deserve."

"And what do I have to do in return?"

"You have to stay away from that woman. And I mean it. If she even enters your dreams, I will find out and things will get much, much worse for you. Understand?"

"Do I have a choice?"

"Not at all."


## HENRY IN LOVE

Dr. Conroy was hesitant to call Salubrious a success. There were seven people living there right now under his care, eight if you included Henry. Losing the woman named Martha to that other refugee had been a set back for the doctor personally, but he recovered from the disappointment and kept his focus trained on Salubrious. The patients that he tended to needed his attention and his care. He needed them to keep his keep his vision going.

Henry, however, was a constant problem for him. The man drew all kinds of unwanted attention to the doctor's facility. Henry had been picked up several times by the local police for this minor infraction and that--loitering, vandalism, and so on. Individually each little infraction was insignificant. Together, however, Henry was starting to get quite a profile with the police.

Perhaps it would be have been a wonderful thing to call the man the town eccentric and leave it at that. Maybe if Henry had been the odd fellow who wore purple pants and didn't eat meat, the towns people would have tolerated it. But Henry was quickly becoming a symptom of a larger problem--the flood of wireless refugees into Ruston. It was the iconic or symbolic aspect of Henry's presence that the doctor was finding hard to manage.

In the last few months, he had been called before into the mayor's office to describe what exactly Salubrious was. The doctor tried not to wax poetic and call it a haven and refuge for the people that are suffering in modern life. The mayor seemed much too no-nonsense for that. In fact, the mayor cut off the doctor in the middle of his explanation and said, "Look, am I going to need to regulate this place or not? You don't have any permits. My people can't find any licenses for you. And you seem to be running some kind of group home. I really don't want to get involved with this. I've got people from all over coming here, moving here and causing trouble for me."

The mayor did have a handful of problems. the doctor knew this. People were suddenly showing up at his office demanding that roads be repaired, suggesting that a park be put here and there. A group had gotten together to petition for a golf course to be constructed. Suddenly permits application for new stores, for additions to houses, and sewer and water lines running this way and that were flooding the mayor's office.

But what could the mayor do? These people, fleeing from the ills of modern life, or at least its electromagnetism, brought money with them. Certainly this was the case with Anthony Charles, who had become something of a ring leader for many of the newcomers, particularly the well to-do ones, the ones with money. These were the people that the mayor wanted to court favor with. 

And who was this doctor? Or so the doctor thought as he sat there. He assumed that the mayor looked at him like a piece of trash. he wasn't a noble man like that Anthony Charles with his German made cars. The doctor was a persistent man and had stuck out bad situation that had gotten much worse than this. He offered to let someone from the mayor's office tour Salubrious and to witness first hand the good it was doing.

The mayor waved away the suggestion. "I don't have time for that. Just keep quiet, and keep this fellow," he flipped through some papers on his desk, "Henry in check, okay?"

The doctor agreed and went about his day.

***

Internally, the doctor had problems with Henry too. The man had taken quite a liking to one of the newcomers--a woman named Deana. Their intensity seemed to match one another quite well. The only problem was that Deana had a violent temper and was prone to chucking things like pots and pans at the man.

A few of the other residents had complained about the commotion that the two of them caused. The oldest resident, a woman simply named "Rita" (she refused to provide any more information about herself), seemed to find the doctor every day to complain about the two of them. "I can't sleep, I can't think," she said. "What good is this place if I can't do that, doctor?"

The people who had come to the doctor didn't have the kind of financial resources to demand golf courses and build new restaurants. This woman, Rita, for instance, was a pauper, more or less. And she was the most well-off of them all. In fact, it very well might have been her monthly contributions alone that was keeping the place afloat. The doctor knew that he could not afford to alienate her, but what could he do. He already knew that Henry was beyond controlling.

The man had been wild after the incidents in Louisville. It was weeks before he stopped pestering the doctor about leaving him "to die." He repeated over and over again, "You didn't know that our paths would cross again. But I did. I knew." It seemed to the doctor that every impulse and urge that the man had during that time he acted out on. He had run out in the middle of the highway. He broke into a truck driver's cabin--didn't steal anything, but how best to explain that to an irate, tired, and rather large truck driver?

And now the doctor had an even bigger problem, Henry was in love, or so the doctor thought. He had tried talking with Deana about the complaints, but she brushed them off. Finally she said, "Doctor, I'm here to survive. I don't care what these people think. This is life or death." And with that kind of gladiatorial attitude, what could he do? Besides, she laughed at the suggestion, made later that Henry was in love with her or had a romantic interest in her.

So, the doctor couldn't get through to her. Could he reason with Henry? After the visit to the mayor's office, the doctor tried talking with Henry who was sitting in the kitchen eating a sandwich.

"We have got to talk about Deana," he said.

"Why?"

"Well, I've just gotten back from the mayor's office and there is going to be trouble for us if you don't settle down. I don't think that she's a good influence on you."

"Oh, thank you for your fatherly concern, doctor!"

This was the reaction the doctor had expected and not the one he had wanted. "I'm not being condescending. Do you want all of this to go away? All that we've worked for?"

"All that you have worked for. What do I care about this?"

"Don't you feel better now being here in this place?"

"There are still forces out there, energies at work. I can feel everything, you know."

"Yes, well, you've complained about the amplification effect before."

"I am seeing inside of people, doctor. I can hear their thoughts now."

The doctor wanted to say, "Then why don't you read mine and layoff," but he didn't. "Well, all the more reason to exercise some caution and restraint, don't you think?"

"Maybe so. I'm not convinced."

"Well, in any event, I'd prefer if you stayed at arm's length from her for a while."

***

A few days later one of Salubrious' more quiet and private residents, a man named George, came to the doctor in a panic. The doctor had a suspicion that the George was in the country illegally, but turned a blind eye and let the man stayed. For the time being he felt that it was better to have people living there than to have no one at all. George disappeared most of the day and evening, often returning late at night. Sometimes the doctor even forgot that George lived there.

Dr. Conroy also didn't know where George was from, but assumed from somewhere in Latin or South America. When he was around to talk and interact with people, he hinted at the possibility that he was some kind of scientist or researcher in a former life. The details, however, were very unclear and shady.

George, who normally faded into the background, refusing to be seen and noticed unless he wanted to be, came rushing into the basement room that the doctor had set up as a an office. The ceiling was low, having been framed in around the old stone basement and wooden joists. George crouched to keep his head out of the recessed lights and started complaining tot he doctor. "Doctor, is it true what that man has been saying?"

"I'm sorry George, which man?"

"That man, your man."

"You mean Henry?"

"Yes, Henry, Henry. Is it true what he has said?"

"I don't know. I can't say for sure. Why don't you tell me what he said."

George seemed to grow impatient with this conversation, but the doctor wished that he knew how he felt. Whatever Henry may or may not have said more or may not be true. The doctor made it a policy to never blindly confirm or deny anything having to do with Henry. "That the police are coming here, that they're bringing INS with them, that they'll be here this week."

The doctor crossed his hands and perched his index fingers under his chin. He twisted in his twisty office chair and rocked back and forth. "No, I haven't heard this, George. Did Henry tell you this directly?"

"No, it was after dinner last night. People were sitting at the table talking. He came in. He was drunk doctor, believe me that he was very drunk, and starting saying how this place was being raided and shut down. He stared at me the whole time, said that INS agents were coming here."

"And you believed him?"

"I don't know, doctor! I don't know if I should believe or not. I cannot afford to nto believe him."

This was the closest admission that the doctor had received that George might be in the country illegally. He really did not want to push the issue much further than this. He did not want to know too much. But George was so worked up that the deoctor felt compelled to calm him down. He did not want this hysteria affecting the other people who lived in Salubrious.

"George, I honestly can't say if this is true or not. I certainly haven't heard anything. I don't know how Henry knows."

"But why would he tell you?"

"Why wouldn't he tell me?"

"He would tell you because he wants us all to leave with him."

The doctor did not know how to take this statement. What kind of crazy game was Henry playing? The doctor, of course, never entertained the idea that George was lying. But why would he have thought such a thing? George clearly had no motive for lying to him about something that obviously materially affected him. Henry, on the other hand, had no motivation, which was a kind of motivation in itself.

"Leave with him? And go where?"

"He didn't say exactly. But he said he knew of a better place for us. A better facility. We would all be treated much better and protected, protected, Dr. Conroy, that is what he said."

"Do you not feel protected here, George?" Now the doctor might have been crossing some kind of unseen barrier that George had created against divulging too much information about himself.

"I'm just fine here, Dr. Conroy. I'm just fine as long as there are no police and no INS. That is all."

"I see. I understand. George, you have my word that I know nothing about a raid. I can't say that a raid won't take place, but I can't say one way or another."

"Thank you for telling the truth, doctor," George replied.

"So, you think that I'm telling the truth?"

"Yes, I can tell that you are now. But regardless, I regret to say that I must leave. My position here is very delicate and there is too much at stake. I must protect my interests in the area, doctor. I hope that you understand this."

"I regret to see you go, but I can't force you to stay." That may or may not have been true, but it certainly sounded better than saying that he would incapacitate him with drugs if he could keep him from leaving. OF course, the doctor could do no such thing and intended to do no such thing.

The very next day George left in the morning to do whatever it was that he did and did not return that evening. He wasn't back in his room later that night. The doctor knew this because he sneaked into the room--having a master key to every room had its uses in situations like these--and found that everything had been cleared out. This man named George, if indeed that was his name, had vanished without a trace. The only thing he left behind was a scrap of paper with a something like looked like a sketch of a circuit board.

***

The doctor determined then that Henry's lie would backfire on him. The doctor continued to assume that Henry had been lying. The mayor really seemed determined to not draw too much attention to the doctor and his operation. He had assumed that if he could in fact minimize the amount of headache he was causing the city then he would left alone. How strange would it be then to suddenly be attaching him on all fronts?

He decided that the best approach would be to find out vis-a-vis Deana whether or nto there was any truth to what Henry was saying. He wasn't quite sure how he would accomplish this, but he would have to figure it out. A few of the other residents were seeming to be a bit restless too an gave him strange looks as he passed by. 

While the doctor did not want his experiment to fall apart, after all he still wasn't exactly sure what it was that he was trying to accomplish, he did wonder if it would be better if these people all just cleared out to let him either move on or find new people to fill their spaces. It was clear to him that people were looking to this area as a refuge and relief from their discomforts in the world of wireless communications, but getting people to commit to Salubrious was tougher. 

It seemed like Ruston, for example, was turning into more a resort than a refuge. Dr. Conroy thought that he was on the side of the refugees, not the restorees. The only bargaining chip that he might have to use was to point to Henry's own instability. While doing so might tarnish him a bit--after all it was clear that Henry was connected to him in some way--he would recover from it once that happened.

Still, he had to find a way to confront Deana. He decided to do so when she was working in the garden one morning.

"You've put a lot of time in this garden, Deana."

"It's something to do."

"I meant that as a compliment. Your work really shows."

"Well, they're plants. They do most of the work."

The doctor was reminded again, if he really needed to be reminded at all, how difficult it was to talk with her. He worried that he would never approach his point in this way. Each comment seemed to fold back on itself and require additional commentary and explanation. Could he just ask her outright? Maybe he could. "Deana, is Henry really leading everyone away form here?"

She stabbed the ground with her small spade, removed her gloves, and sat back on her legs. "Yes, he is, and I intended to go with him."

The doctor's veneer of polish and politics suddenly wore too thin to coat his true reaction. "Are you crazy? Is he crazy? Where do you plan to go?"

"He found some empty workers cottages by an old mill outside of town. We'll live there. Can't be any worse than here."

"Deana, please listen to what I'm saying, because I will only say it once. You have no idea what I do to keep this place running. You don't realize the sacrifices that I have made to see this through. Do you understand how much persuasion and coaxing it takes to allow us to live here in peace and harmony." The doctor was only slightly exaggerating his claims about the amount of energy and attention he had poured in to making Salubrious. 

"It doesn't matter doctor, it is time for us to leave."

"But Deana, you don't even like him."

Clearly the doctor had gone too far with this comment. Deana stood up now and looked him in the eyes. "Don't tell me what I think and don't think. Don't tell me where I'm going to live and not live. And most of all don't tell me what I feel about people. You don't know how I feel. You're as bad as my brother and he's the biggest asshole that I ever met. You're getting pretty close now, doctor."

"Deana, I didn't mean anything by that. It's just all very surprising, I guess."

"Well, maybe it's just time for a change, for all of us."

Her response left little room for him to maneuver. The doctor walked away from this short conversation resigned to the fact that everything might fall apart. If people indeed felt this way, what could he do to stop them from leaving? He thought it was insane and almost like sentencing this people to a kind of death in life to follow Henry, but what could he do?

It was perhaps the strangest and most puzzling contradiction that made up the doctor--the propensity and willingness to manipulate people but also believe in their absolute inability to be persuaded or dissuaded from doing or thinking something. Perhaps he was absolute in his thinking about these issues. Either someone was a mark, or the weren't. They only problem, of course, was the doctor had rarely, if ever, encountered the real mark--the the real believer who would be taken for a ride no matter what that person's common sense might be telling him or her.

***

Finally the doctor decided that he needed to address the problem head on. He called all of the residents of Salubrious together the next day to address their departure. He started in a very casual way, not wanting to raise any alarms among the rebel host. He started by talking about George. "I strongly belief that George is not coming back now."

Rita, who always raised her hand despite being a 76 year old woman, raised her hand, waiting to be called on. The doctor called on her to let her speak. "You've heard from him or talked with him, then?"

"No, I haven't. He just vanished one night. I can speculate about what happened, but I don't want to do that."

"What about his project?" asked Jacqueline, a middle aged black woman who was an early arrival at  Salubrious some time ago. "How will this affect that?"

Although he didn't know what she was talking about, he decided to pretend that he did. "I don't think that it will. I think that his work will be just fine. But George isn't the only thing that I wanted to discuss. I want to talk about the rumor that many of you are planning to leave Salubrious." Whether because they were confused or guilty, the people sitting there didn't react at all to him.

"I'm not going to stay here if I can't trust you," said Jacqueline. "I need to know that you aren't going call the cops on us. Did you call the cops on us?"

"Call the cops? No, why would I do that?" the doctor replied.

"That's what Henry said," she returned.

Rita spoke up now, "Henry said that you were trying to steal out money. That you would have this place shut down and steal our money."

"Not true either. Look, no one cares that we're here. No one is going to bother us," the doctor pleaded.

Just then Henry walked in with a half eaten sandwich. He nibbled at the edges of it while he stood at the doorway. Everyone turned to him, but he didn't seem bothered by this at all. The doctor, stepping forward to him, said, "Henry, we're talking about what you've been saying to these people."

"What have I been saying?"

"Well, that I called the police; that I'm trying to steal their money."

"I'm only repeating what's already in their heads," he said.

"Okay, well, either way, are you planning to take these people to live elsewhere? Are you going to leave?"

Henry spit his bite of sandwich out and started laughing, "Take these people anywhere? Why in the world would I do that? I need to get away from all of these people; I don't need to be around them."

Deana, who had been sitting in the back of the room, stood up and started shouting, "You said that we were leaving! That was the plan!"

"Well, it's not, so you can just sit down again."

The doctor interjected, "So, you are not leaving?"

"No, I'm not planning to go anywhere."

Deana stood up, "I can't believe you. George left because of you. I was going to leave because of you."

"Then leave, I won't stop you."

Deana stormed out of the room and stomped through the house. The doctor felt concerned about what might happen while she banged and bashed her way back to her room, but felt that he couldn't just leave the rest of the people here. "Okay, look, I want to make it clear to everyone that Henry has been lying, that the cops aren't coming, that I'm not trying to steal your money. Okay, none of it is true."

"Not true!? What of it is true, doctor?" Henry was waving his arms now. "Is the plan and the cure and the care that we get here true? Are you true and wise and fearless? A visionary? What do you see, doctor, in all of us? What kind of opportunity are we for you? You've got too much of the world on you, doctor. At least, I'm pure. And I see inside of everyone and myself. True!"

"Henry, get out! Get out now!" the doctor shouted. Things had finally gone too far. As long as the tacit agreement between them held up, the doctor could tolerate Henry's eccentricities. But now it had gone too far.

"You're going to make me leave too! But how will you know what you know? How will you find out about the people who come through here? Who is going to do your dirty work, doctor?" He held up his hand with the lopped off finger. "Because I'm pretty sure that my hands are dirty."

The other people in the room seemed paralyzed by this fight. They weren't even really spectators, only have understanding what they were witnessing. Much as he had before, the doctor walked up to Henry and grabbed him by the arm and started to drag him out the room. This reserve of strength and power was limited for him, but could manifest itself on these occasions, much as it had before.

The doctor dragged Henry to the front door and tossed him out onto the porch. "I don't want you in here if you can't behave yourself, Henry."

"Well, the great Dr. Conroy finally reveals the prick that he really is," Henry replied.

"Guess I should have let you get arrested for being a rapist and pedophile or maybe for breaking and entering or let the police here lock you up for just being a nuisance. Somehow, you've managed to stay out of jail the entire time that I've known you. And this is how you thanks me?"

Henry spit at him, picked himself up off of the porch and wobbled his way through the yard and down the street. The doctor had no idea where he would go and didn't care at that moment either.


## A PROMOTION

Greg Maloney had been true to his word. He had put his head down and worked hard at the coffee shop. He always showed up on time, had the store ready to open, and greeted the first customers of the day with a boundless good cheer. He learned people's names and greeted them like old friends when they came in the shop. He prepared drinks with a care and attention to detail that made him the favorite of everyone who truly cared about coffee.

The store manager was arrested for drug charges after a few months of Greg working there. Since the other employees were all kids who had just graduated college or from PhD programs, Greg was tipped as the heir apparent to the manager. Before he could assume the mantle of his new role, however, he had to travel east to visit with people in the regional office and then to a professional development workshop for managers in Washington DC. 

During the trip, he would have a few days of free time to spend poking around the capital or doing whatever else he chose to do. He checked and double checked that the time would be his own. Because it was both the first and fourth times he asked, he decided that he should visit Martha in Ruston.

It might seem strange that he would inconvenience himself in this way, but the thought seemed completely natural to him. After all, he had not blamed her for leaving him. He realized that she was being propelled by forces that were out of her control. She had been convinced that her health was at peril. He was not convinced, or refused to be convinced. He certainly could have moved with her to Ruston. Nothing was holding him in place other than himself.

His acceptance of her departure, in other words, was just as selfish as the departure itself. It was inconvenient, but the inconvenience generally paled in comparison to the colossal mess that their marriage had become. So, why not let her leave and start over?

As Greg drove to the airport, he recalled driving Martha to the airport some months earlier, recalled how tense and strange the experience had been. He barely recalled himself participating in the scene. Had he truly been there? If there had been some sort of transcript or recording of the event, someone might have been able to convince him of his participation. But even then Greg felt a little skeptical.

The same might be said of much of recent life. Thinking back over the last few years, it was as if he blipped in and out of the frame. Maybe when the signal got too weak, his image broke up beyond repair. But why didn't he have the strength or resolve to bring everything back into focus? That was the central question and mystery. For some reason, Greg had let his life get blurry and strange and unlivable.

Maybe there would always be something blurry and unreal about his life to himself. Even with the incredible energy that he undertook his barista work, Greg sometimes realized that it wasn't really Greg who was doing these things, but someone called Greg who lived his life and worked his job and had experienced the things that he experienced. This feeling wasn't a threatening or bad feeling, but just the way that he sometimes experienced things.

The advantage of such a feeling was that Greg never took that image of Greg too seriously. That Greg, the one in the world seemed to do just fine and get along well enough. So, Greg was content to let that Greg live out its existence. The two could cope with each other well enough. Trying to resolve the two or drive them closer together probably wouldn't accomplish much.

***

Greg flew to his meetings and attend them too. He sat through numerous presentations about company vision and ethics. He worked through an entire coffee tasting course with several people called brew masters or master brewers. By the end he could taste the subtle differences in regional beans and roasting methods. He felt very satisfied with this knowledge and reported this fact to he master brewers.

He also got to learn about the day to day life of being a manager, and what duties this role entailed. It seemed that much of what the old manager did was wrong and now Greg was being charged with fixing it. So be it. Fix it he would. And so his trainers and supervisors sent him on his way charged to be a better manager and a more effective leader for store number 1997.

Really, surviving this part of the trip had been easy. Greg really did enjoy his job and liked coffee. So, having to sit around and think about his job and taste coffee wasn't all that bad. He had to mentally prepare for seeing Martha now. The rental car that he picked up from the airport had a GPS system that he could use to get pretty close to the radio quiet zone, after that he would have to navigate on his own.

Greg drove north along a mega highway to get to Ruston. He made the mistake of leaving too early in the morning, not thinking about the influx of traffic that would clog up the megahighway running, as it did, north and south from Washington D.C. But he was in no particular hurry and just relaxed in the car as he crept along inch by inch.

Several hours later he was passing farms and then scattered houses into Ruston. He was surprised by how small of the town it was, though it was clear that it was growing. As he drove around, he noticed construction being done all over the place. Much of the main street area was ripped up and torn down. Machines seem to have taken over the town square. Diggers and dump trucks and semis loaded with building supplies crossed this way and that.

Greg circled around the town center until he saw the hotel where he thought Martha said she would be staying. It was near a nearly burned down theater, which was one conspicuous building not currently under construction. He parked in front of the hotel, marveling at the lack of parking meters or pay boxes. He felt bad taking up a parking space and not recompensing the town for it. But there was no cash box for his sensitive feelings and he quickly forgot about it as he entered the hotel.

The hotel had been a grand Victorian looking hotel at one point. It still had a Victorian feel, but as if everything inside of it had been processed by a machine that produced Victorian looking things. No one was behind the winding dark brown counter, so Greg rang the bell. An older woman in a green sweater, looking rather harassed came from the back office.

"Looking for a room? We don't have any? I just filled the last one."

"No, I don't need a room. I'm looking for someone." The woman just stared at him. "A woman. Her name is Martha X."

"I don't know her."

"But I think she stayed here recently."

"Look, young man, there have been so many passing through this place in recent months, that I don't know who's coming or going. Everyone is looking to escape the magnetic waves or whatever it is. I can't add more rooms, I don't have more beds."

The woman didn't seem to realize that the second half of her lament didn't really apply to him. "Well, I'm looking for her. I know that she moved down here a few months ago."

"Try Mr. Charles."

"Who is that?"

"Anthony Charles. He knows all of the newcomers, the refugees as they call themselves. As if this were some kind of encampment or something, sheesh."

The phone started to ring. The woman moved to pick it up. "Where can I find him?"

"Mr. Charles? Well, he's always at the golf course on Wednesdays."

Greg didn't move. The woman answered the phone, turned and produced a tourists map of the area, and draw a squiggly black line from the hotel to the other side of town. There was nothing there on the map, but she wrote, "Golf Course" in her squiggly hand writing and circled it. With the map in hand, Greg left the hotel and proceeded to follow the same black line to find Mr. Charles.

***

From a distance, the golf course appeared to be little more than a field. There was a club house at the end of long driveway surrounded by a few young trees. Further off, Greg could see earth movers pushing around dirt to build up and expand the course. He pulled up in front of the club house and asked inside for Mr. Charles. He had expected that this request might be met with some reservation or suspicion. Quite the opposite. Obviously so many people asked for this man, that it was a matter of course to point him out to people.

He was sitting at a table outside under a large sun umbrella drinking with a few other men and a woman. When Greg approached, they all turned to smile at him, including the man who had been pointed out as being Mr. Charles. He stood up and took the lead, "Can I help you young man?"

"The woman inside said that you were Mr. Charles."

"That's correct. And what's your name?"

"My name is Greg."

"Well, sit down Greg." As soon as the man said this, others' chairs began scrapping and sliding aside to create a sliver of an opening for him. They were crowded around the table, but the others seemed happy to do so. Maybe being cramped and crowded in this man's presence was better than not.

"Okay, sure."

"Can I offer you anything to drink?"

"Just some water. I've been on the road, so just some water."

The woman leaned forward, "Oh, where you heading from?"

"Oh, just down south." They all nodded at this, as if knowing exactly what this meant. Of course, Greg had no idea what this meant or if in fact it meant anything.

The bartender from the club's bar came out and asked if they needed anything. The man named Mr. Charles ordered a whiskey and soda and whatever else everyone wanted. "I'm fine with water," Greg asserted again. He didn't mean to reject their graciousness and hospitality, but he was really very thirsty.

The people sitting at the table continued with whatever scraps of conversation they had been chewing on before he arrived. When the next round of drinks arrived, they continued to chat politely. They asked impersonal and polite questions about Greg. He told them that he was a store manager for a coffee shop chain. They nodded. He said that he had observed the bad weather coming from the west. And so on.

When they finished their drinks, Mr. Charles stood up and said, "well, why don't you ride out with me for a few holes of golf."

"I don't really play," Greg replied.

The others tried to hide their smirks with gentle smiles. Greg realized that he wasn't following some kind of script or procedure that had been well-established and often performed in front of these people, who seemed to function like this man's court. But Greg still didn't really understand what it was that they expecting him to do.


Looking around he said quickly, "But, I'll ride along and watch."

"Maybe you'll like what you see and want to play too," one of the men at the table said.

So, Greg reluctantly got on the cart. This man seemed easy going enough and killing an hour on a golf cart wouldn't be that terrible. They walked over to the golf cart shed. Greg held open the wobbly shed door as the man drove his cart out. Greg hopped on and the electric motor zipped them down the wide cart trail to the first hole.

As they rode, Greg noticed the man glancing over at him. He guessed that he was supposed to say something, but at this point he wasn't entirely clear what his purpose was anymore. "This is the part where you tell me a little bit more about yourself and why you came to Ruston. I'll offer to help get you established and set up. And in so doing, we cement a casual bond and you become a part of our group."

"Really? No, there must be come confusion. I'm not moving here. Did you think I was a refugee?"

The man stopped the cart suddenly, pitching Greg forward. "Then why else are you here?" There was something menacing in his tone now. Greg saw the man's hands, wrapped in soft grey leather gloves, tighten around the cart's steering wheel.

"I'm looking for someone."

"And why do you think that I would know how to help you."

"Well, like I said, the woman at the hotel thought that you might know."

"And did she say why?"

"No," Greg replied very casually. He was trying, as much as possible, to keep his tone even and calm to offset the tension in the man's voice and manner. The man turned the car around and started to head back for the club house. "Are you not playing golf any more?" Greg asked.

"I'm not sure that I'm in the mood anymore," the man replied. "Besides, I think that it might be best if you were to get back in your car and go home."

"But I haven't even asked you to help me yet. I haven't asked you my question."

"And what is your question?"

"I'm looking for a woman named Martha. Do you know her?" The car seemed to speed up until they reached the parking lot where it came skidding to a halt. Greg got out of the cart automatically, sensing that it really was time to leave. "Look, I just need to know where I can find her."

"And why are you looking for her Mr. Maloney?"

"She's my ex-wife and I was just passing through."

The man sped off in his cart, leaving Greg there to wonder about the strangeness of this place called Ruston.


## FINDING MARTHA

Since arriving in Ruston and settling in, Martha's life had taken on a very unexpected character. To many she was like the princess of Ruston, of the new Ruston that was being rebuilt in the image of the refugees who flooded the town. It seemed to her that every week she was expected to meet and greet with more and more people. 

Martha tried to avoid these meeting as much as she could. She often used long romantic escapes with Anthony as an excuse. The longer she could keep in preoccupied in his remote house, the better. But even there the new world encroached. The living room quickly became an impromptu meeting space. Developments were planned and plans developed by people that she barely recognized sitting around the large wool rug that anchored the bright living room space.

At the center of that, of course, was Anthony. Their meeting had been so dramatic and strange that Martha rarely questioned her attraction to him. That said, she did occasionally become aware of his age and the disparity of their backgrounds. She was essentially an office girl, in the old sense, someone whose path and future was seemingly bound to that old notion of the secretary pool. Had she not broken apart her old life, then she would probably still be working as an Office Assistant II in the department and retire there are so on.

Anthony, on the other hand, still betrayed his well-heeled and privileged background. Rather, he never really tried to shake it off. Exotic and expensive food arrived at the house on a regular basis. He was always buying and having shipped to him art and furniture and jewelry, always jewelry for her. To say that she had grown bored of it would not be accurate. Perhaps if years and years had gone by and all of this commerce was done with little feeling behind it, then she would have been disgusted by it. But each new acquisition either for the house or for her was accompanied by such feeling from Anthony, that Martha couldn't help but relish it.

After all, hadn't Greg been such a dower, non-entity in her life. He had really done nothing in inject any of himself in their life together. Had he really participated at all, she wondered. Instead, she now lived her life with a man who seemed to relish each minute of his day, who acted out his impulses, his thoughts, and his desires in the waking world. Martha, in other words, couldn't help but be seduced by the seductive nature of contrasts. 

And then something unexpected happened, though perhaps not all that unexpected by Anthony. Martha suddenly lost interest in him and wanted to untangle her life from his. This change of heart happened around the same time that the young man showed up at the cabin with a flat tire. Martha experienced that scene as an observer and didn't like what she saw. Suddenly Anthony's warmth and generosity could be seen as a cover for a deep seated paranoia and aggression.

This was to say nothing of the man in the white hat, Terry. Martha had little to do with him on most days. Anthony hired a man to handle the horses that he acquired for her after an incident between her and Terry. The incident involved him handling a horse in an overly rough manner. The horse reared back and knocked her against the side of the pen. She hadn't blamed him directly when she reported the incident to Anthony, but made it clear that the whole situation was not satisfactory.

AFter that Martha could ride her horses in peace, come and go in peace, and generally not have to see the man in the white hat. Not seeing him meant that she didn't have to think about him. Not thinking about him meant that she didn't have to acknowledge the function--and maybe an essential function--that he played in Anthony's life.

But after the scene with the young man, Martha realized that her boyfriend had a hired enforcer on hand. That she was dating someone who kept muscle around and used said muscle to protect his interests. Maybe if Martha had actually come from a similarly privileged background as he did, she would have brushed off this insight and considered the whole thing to part of the way that people with power and money continue to have power and money. Terry was just like loop holes in tax codes or laws that subtly favor the rich. Of course she didn't come from this place or this perspective and an office girl can always spot a bully. In fact, maybe an office girl was even more sensitive to a bully than otherwise.

Her decision to visit the young man was a weird one--one that she didn't fully understand herself. She just felt compelled to make some acknowledgment of her role in the whole thing and to communicate to someone--to make real--that she saw the whole thing from a different perspective. Without physically doing it and conveying it to someone, maybe ti would cease to exist for her. Or at least, that was her fear.

Now, the consequences of having done so were very real to her. Terry watched her like a hawk. Anthony was increasingly stiff and unnatural around her. She felt like a maiden being held in a tower by a knight run amok and a dragon with a close shaven head and white cowboy hat with a yellowing band of sweat crawling up from the brim.

***

Anthony couldn't build a moat around his house or keep her in chains. At least, he hadn't done either of these things yet. She still had a limited degree of freedom to exercise and used it to exercise. She took up running at least three or four times a week. The distances got longer and longer and the routes more complicated. Anthony tried to load her down with emergency gear, whistles, anything to keep her safe. She finally agreed to wear a shiny orange vest when she ran early in the morning (long before he woke up) and to carry a knife with her in case she was attacked.

Perhaps because her feelings had not completely soured for him, Martha relented on these few points and carried the knife and wore the silly vest when she ran. Unfortunately for Anthony, his concern with safety and security had unintended consequences.

Martha went out for a run early in the evening, though after Day lights saving time had ended and day and night seemed to crash into one another with no regard for people and their schedules. But, she wanted to get in a run before dinner time. Anthony had a whole cow delivered the previous month and some of the meat had cured to a point that he felt satisfied to cook it. He had hired a famous chef to drive into town and prepare them a meal.

With her vest on and her running shoes and black leggings, Martha went out to run. She never had a specific goal or distance in mind. She just knew that for some amount of time, she would exert herself and simply move. Not worrying about the pace and destination was very liberating. She reduced running down to the simplest of operations--two feet moving forward in time and space, her heart and lungs exerting themselves to keep her blood flowing and properly oxygenated. That was it. That was all that she worried about. 

She even tried not to think while she ran. On this night, she pulled her black sporty stocking cap down tightly over her hair and just started to run. She was very nondescript from a distance. In fact, she could have been anyone, particularly to the person driving down the road, heading towards her. She didn't take much notice of the car at first, but did notice, from the little lights mounted around the license plate, that the car was from New Jersey. This struck her as odd and she wondered why a car from New Jersey was all the way here.

As the car got closer to her, it kept its pace, then started the slow down, then stopped quickly, throwing up dust as it did. Martha looked back at the standing, running car, wondering if she should be grasping her pocket knife. The idea of a attacking a car with a pocket knife seemed ridiculous to her so she decided to keep running and even picked up her pace a little.

The car's reverse lights lit up and the car began whirring as it backed up quickly. She tried to run even faster, but short of full out sprinting, she didn't know how long she could run faster than the car. She reconciled herself to whatever fate was in store for her, slowed down a little and let the car catch up to her.

"Martha?"

Martha stooped down, look inside the car and saw Greg sitting there, looking back at her. "Greg, what are you doing here? How did you find me?"

"Your yellow vest. I saw your yellow vest. Before that I asked a lot of people. Many, many people."

"But what are you doing in Ruston at all. Why did you come here?"

Greg turned and looked down the road. He seemed to be catching his breath. He turned back, his tone of voice shifted subtly as he began to talk again, "I was passing through on my way to D.C. after a training. I thought that I would say hello. This has not been as easy as I expected." Martha didn't reply. "Look why don't get in the car. Can I buy you a coffee or something?"

"But how did you find out where I was living?"

"I don't know. Some guy told me that I ran across at a bar. Strange guy, muttered, missing part of his finger. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm not trying to intrude. I can leave."

"No, I'll get in. Just let's hurry, okay? I have to get back."

"Okay, get in."

She got into the car, removed her black hat and vest. "That vest is pretty crazy. I probably would have driven right past you if you hadn't been wearing that." he said. Martha looked down at the vest. Was it a good thing or a bad thing that she had it on? At least she had intercepted him first before he got to the house.

"Say, do you know someone named Charles Anthony?"

"Sort of...casually... Why?"

"Oh, everyone I talk to keeps mentioning his name with yours. It's almost like you two are dating now," he chuckled. "You look good. You look healthy. Do you feel better?"

"Yes, I guess that I do." As they drove, MArtha decided that they couldn't go into town. She couldn't risk being seen with him. No one would know who he was, but enough people would know that he wasn't Anthony to make problems for her. Some damage probably had already been done just by him asking, but there were some things that were beyond her control. She knew that there was a nice trail head and picnic area another quarter mile. Maybe they could pull off and talk "Greg, I don't want to have to drive all the way into town and then drive me back. There's a really nice picnic area up ahead, let's stop there and talk."

Martha was hoping that Greg's inner resolve had been weakened by dealing with the difficult people of Ruston. She was right, he nodded his head and pulled off in a quarter mile. The small road was lined with trees and opened onto a picnic area that bordered some rocky outcroppings. Not cliffs per se, but just just jagged and extreme enough to make the scene a picturesque spot for eating and light hiking.

Anthony had brought her here when they first met. They spent the afternoon walking and talking and losing track of time. It wasn't until they had heard Terry crashing through the woods to come after them that they turned back.

Greg pulled off the road and stopped the car. "It's beautiful here. I have to give you that. It's not city, but certainly is beautiful."

"Greg," Martha said with more desperation in her voice than she had intended. "I can't go back with you."

Greg seemed shocked, had she undone his plan? "Martha, I don't want you to come back with me. That's not why I'm here."

"But that's what it looks like. How can I believe you when it doesn't seem that way?"

"Beacuse I'm telling you."

"But what if I don't believe you."

"Bu why don't you believe me. I'm telling you that I'm not here to lure you back to the bad city. My life has finally gotten back on track. You know being with you made me just as crazy as it made you."

This probably was the most direct thing that he had said to her during their entire time together. Martha, who had turned herself sideways in her chair, say back and looked out at the receding light of the sky. She felt completely unhinged inside and started to think crazy, desperate thoughts. She felt like this entire scene was a mistake, that she needed to edit out this portion of her evening. 

In part she felt with way because knowing what the consequences of this meeting would be was just too difficult for her. How would Anthony react to the news that she had gotten into a car--with no threat of violence--with her ex-husband and driven to a remote, isolated spot. Moreover what would Terry do to her if he found out or was given the orders from Anthony--the chain of command was always a little unclear to her in situations like these.

As if the darkening streaks of red in the sky reminded her of aggressive editing marks, Martha decided that the scene could not exist and had to be stricken out. She turned aggressively and straddled Greg in his seat. She started kissing him recklessly, not passionately, just with abandon. At first he struggled, but she kept at it until he gave in and kissed back.

he began running his hands under her tight sweatshirt, up her stomach and over her breasts. His hands quickly retreated down and squeezed at her thighs. he rubbed the slick nylon of her leggings between his fingers. She could hear the roughness of his fingers scrapping over the fine fabric of the leggings.

As he groped her and kissed her, she reached in the back pocket of her vest, drew out the pocket knife, leaned back and began stabbing him in the chest. She stabbed him and stabbed him. He cried out and tried to fight her off, but she was fierce and determined. Her stabbing was as persistent and persuasive as her kissing. He was bloody, but finally he was dead, leaving Martha to figure out what to do with his body.


## THE HEAT CLOSES IN

As it approached midnight, Jason decided to take a break and get some fresh air outside. The small telescope that had been his burden since arriving in the radio quiet zone was almost finished thanks to the infusion of cash from the "mystery donor" who had taken an interest in his project. Dane, the surly tech, also had a new found, though somewhat begrudging, respect for Jason too. Boards were soldered quickly and with amazing artistry. The metal rods and fixtures he needed were cut with precision and neatly piled and ready and ready to be added to the machine.

The only recent set back that Jason had experienced was losing his unofficial, underground project advisor. A man named George had shown up at his apartment one morning saying that he was there to help him with his research and the project. Jason tried to get more information out of him, but the man was very reluctant to say more. All Jason had to do was to bring his work to the local library and George would help him with it.

George proved to be a very reliable sounding board and helped him out of a jam. He clearly understood what needed to be done to fix the telescope and how best to use it once it was. Jason felt confident now about the direction of his research with the help of his underground help.

He knew that taking money from his new patron was probably not a good thing to do, but he felt that getting through this year of work was essential for the rest of his career. If he failed now, he would be derailed for the rest of his life. At least it seemed that way to him.

Sitting on the balcony of his apartment, it was a welcome relief for him to be sitting in the cool autumn night, feeling the mountain breezes rolling around him, and breath deeply. He felt very satisfied and very calm now. He felt like he appreciated his surrounding more. Even seeming the enormous space telescope in the distance that towered over everything seemed less sinister and sensational like now. Jason felt more confident that it wasn't attuned to his every twitch and murmur.

He was surprised to see a car pull up and park this late at night. The headlights stayed on as a woman got out, looked up at him, and disappearing into lobby of his building. The buzzer sounded inside. Jason wasn't sure why the woman was visiting him but knew that it would lead to no good. Still, he had been detected and couldn't pretend that he wasn't home. Maybe it was even some kind of strange test being given to him by his patron. Maybe if he didn't help her that would prove some kind of guilt about a deeper connection.

Rather than thinking through all of these possibilities, Jason pressed the button to open the door and let her in. He left the door ajar and stood in the kitchen waiting for her. When she came inside, he was surprised that she was dressed in running clothes, but not wearing a jacket, especially considering how cold it was.

"I'm sorry to be here, but I had to go somewhere."

"What's wrong?"

"I need help. I need your help."

"Why do you need my help? Seems like you could get all the help you need."

"Don't talk about that. I can't go to him. And I can't let the man in white cowboy hat find out either."

"Find out what."

"Can you get into the lab this late?"

"Sure, we can come and go pretty freely."

"Is it busy there now?"

"Hard to say. I don't think that any experiments are running. So, no, it's probably pretty quiet."

"Good, good." She was pacing around now .She seemed calm but a tremor of anxiety undercut the calmness. She seemed to be fretting over something, but trying to restrain the worry at the same time. "Okay, come downstairs."

"Where are we going?"

"Just don't ask too many questions yet. For some reason I feel like I can trust you. I'm not sure that I can say that about many people right now. Can I trust you?"

"Sure, I guess so."

"Okay, first, grab some sheets and let's go down." When they were down in the parking lot, she asked him, "Is your car here" He nodded and pointed to an old diesel Volkswagen van. "I want you to follow me."

"Where are we going?"

"Don't ask, just follow me."

Jason didn't drive his van very often and worried that it wouldn't start up. It was very temperamental these days. The van started up after a few cranks. Jason pulled out onto the street and followed this strange woman to the lab.

***

They were on the road that led to the man's house where Jason had first seen the woman. He wondered why she was leading him there. Then the woman pulled off the road. Jason followed her down a small dirt road to a clearing that appeared to be a picnic area. She stopped the car; he pulled back behind her. She ran up to the window and tapped. He rolled down the window to see what she wanted. "Grab your sheets."

Jason decided to go along with this seemingly crazy, even ridiculous, series of events, partly because he was curious how they would unfold. Certainly doing this was more interesting than scanning journal articles. He got out and grabbed the sheets from the van. The woman was walking and scanning the ground as if looking for a lethal pin or something else harmful that had been dropped on the floor.

She seemed to find what she was looking far, waved him towards her, and started clearing away leaves. When the large piles of leaves began to thin, Jason recoiled back saying, "Oh!" Only partially hidden under the leaves now was a dead body.

"Who is that?" he said pointing. "How did you know this was here?" He stared at her in horror. She stood up and grabbed his hands. She began petting them with her soft, slender fingers. The effect was hypnotizing. Jason felt much more calm that before.

"Dont' worry. I just need your help getting him out of here."

"Did you kill him?"

The woman pretended not to hear question and cleared more leaves to the dead body's left hand side. With the leaves more or less cleared away, Jason helped shimmy the sheet under the man as the woman tipped the body this way and that. Jason started to notice that her nice leather running gloves were splattered in blood--that everything on her suggested some kind of encounter with blood. Now he was starting to worry about where this was going.

They wrapped the man in the sheet. The woman did most of the work. "We're going to move this into you car." She grabbed the floor mats from the car she drove and laid them down in the back of his van. As he stood there and watched, she raced back to help him grab the body. "Are you going to help of not?" she said in a challenging way. Did she realize that she was prodding him to help her move a dead body?

The body was hoisted into the back of the van and placed on the car mats. "That'll help absorb any blood," she said.


She walked back to the car and he said, "Do I want to know what's going on here?"

"No, I don't think you do. I'm not sure that I would tell you anyway. Is that okay?"

"I guess it has to be." And, indeed, it did. After all, he had a dead body in the back fo the can now. he couldn't exactly walk away now. The woman was dousing the car in gasoline. When she was done she ran back to the van and hopped in. She pushed in the dashboard cigarette lighter and waited for it to heat up. When she pulled it out, the ceramic element inside was glowing in rings of hot orange and red. She lit a tissue form her pocket on fire and tossed it in a puddle of gasoline that she left behind. 


AS they drove away the car burst into flames, and would probably burn down most of the forest too, thought Jason. But right now he was just focused on getting the body out of his car. He wondered, as they drove, if this was one of the men that he had encountered before. Had the woman killed her lover in a passionate anger over infidelity or something like that. Maybe she had killed the man in the white cowboy hat. Maybe their encounters had grown violent and unpredictable.

They got in to the lab easily. The guard waved them through thanks to the little semi-permanent window decal. Driving through the compound, the woman asked, "Is there some kind of power plant or incinerator around here?" she asked.

"Sure, it's nearby." They drove to the building housing the lab's physical plant. The lot brick building was the convergence point for a network of wires and cables--at least whatever wires were still permitted in the radio quiet zone. When they reached the plant, Jason stopped the car. "So, are you going to tell me what's going on now?"

Martha was staring out the window, "Ist here anyone coming?"

He looked again and shook his head, "I don't think so."

"I killed that man in the back of your van. I killed him tonight."

Jason calmly nodded his head. "And who is he?"

"My ex-husband."

"Does the man in the white cowboy hat know? Aren't you worried about the consequences of this?"

Martha indicated that her answer to both questions was "no." But she realized that the young man might be thinking that she was referring to Anthony. "No, this is my ex-husband, from before when I moved here. He stayed home."

It was the first time that she had used home in a while. How strange that she should use the word to describe the place she left and the man who had been a participating in the marriage that she broke apart. 

Jason wondered if there had been some kind of violent confrontation between them. Maybe the ex-husband was going to take her back to the place they called home. Whether it was true or not, thinking this comforted him and reconciled him to the task at hand, though he still wasn't entirely sure what that task might be.

"So, what are we going to do exactly?"

"Put him in the incinerator. Remove all evidence of him being here."

"Are you sure that this is a good idea?"

"What else am I supposed to do? That thing has been done. Now this thing needs to be done."

They got to the incinerator and took the body wrapped in sheets out of the van. The woman was surprising strong all of a sudden, Jason thought. They carried the body to the incinerator and lobbed it inside. Within seconds the sheets caught fire and then body began to burn up.

***

After doing the thing that needed to be done, they drove away and sat in Jason's van for some time. Neither or them said a word. The woman finally got out of the van and began walking home. Jason thought that he should call after her or drive alongside her and plead for her to return, to let him take her back home, wherever that might be.

He started the van up, but saw her walking back towards him. He rolled down the window. "I feel like I have to say this," she said. "I feel like I have to say this to make it real. I don't know what happened to my life here. Everything became so strange. I moved here to get better, to escape everything that was making me ill and weighing on me. And yet I feel like I can't escape life here. It haunts me and teases me and prods at me. I just don't understand it."

Jason didn't have anything particular to say. He tried to reassure her, but what could he do? He barely knew this woman and she was trying to lay her inner most secrets at his feet and ask him to mold them into something. Or maybe she wasn't. Maybe the point was to unburden herself of something that refused to let go. Jason, as he drove home, thought about how things that get a hold of you rarely let go. Instead, you find yourself changed and altered and that thing is to blame and you didn't even realize it. But what was the point of blaming yourself for something that you weren't even able to realize was happening? 

When he got back to his apartment, he was surprised to find his door unlocked, but less surprised to find the man in the white cowboy hat sitting in his living room. "This is a comfortable chair," the man said. "I almost dozed off several times waiting for you."

"Sorry to keep you waiting," Jason replied. "Was I supposed to meet you?"

"No, no appointment on the books. I just saw something peculiar and wanted to follow up on it."

"What did you see?" Jason had retreated into the kitchen to get something to drink, maybe to grab and knife and defend himself--he wasn't sure what.

"I saw you and Martha riding in your van together."

"Oh, that's strange."

"No, it's not strange. I know what you were doing. I saw everything, even thought she didn't realize it. That woman thinks she hides everything so well. She doesn't realize that all of her secrets are just siting there beside her at her feet, just waiting to be picked up by someone." The man had gotten up from the chair and cornered Jason in the small kitchen. "And when someone leaves their secrets lying around, I'm the kind of person who figures out a way to pick them up and collect them and hold onto them. Do you know what I mean, Jason?"

"I guess that I do."

"I think that you do very well. I think that I've even got a few of yours in my collection now. I've got them stashed away in a tidy little corner," the man pointed at his head as he said this.

"Well, good night."

"That's it!?" Jason asked, somewhat bewildered that he wasn't being assaulted by this menacing man.

"Yep, that's it for now. Of course, I've got some work to do tonight. Amateurs should be left to do a professional's job. I'm also very good at cleaning up other people's messes. And here, just to make things fair, I'll hand you one of my secrets. I think I acquired this skill because my mother was a drunk, a mess of a woman, and always needed someone to pick up after her. See, now we're even. You store that one away for me, okay?"

With this enigmatic message, the man in white cowboy hat left Jason alone in his apartment.


## THE END OF SALUBRIOUS

It was strange to think that everything about Salubrious would change after Henry and Deana left. Rather than calming down, the place seemed to become more and more unwound. The people who had come there to be cured started to leave one by one. Rita was the first to leave. She bothered the doctor about it constantly for several days before she finally left.

The day before her final departure, she knocked at the doctor's room, "Doctor! Doctor!" Her shriveled paper thin hands--she always complained of being cold--were surprising strong when banging insistently on a door the doctor thought. He dragged himself out of bed, only half dressed, unshaven, and answered the door.

Why was he disheveled and drunk at this time of day? It was hard for him to say. He felt defeated by the events leading up to Henry and Deana's departure. He also chided himself for letting Henry into his life. Even though he reasoned that it was too late for worrying over that decision, his newly despairing state of mind didn't pass up the opportunity to point out the obvious flaws in his decisions.

"Doctor! Doctor! I need to talk to you immediate... Doctor, you look terrible. What is wrong with you?"

"Wrong with me? Nothing is wrong with me. What's wrong with me?"

"I can smell alcohol on your breath, doctor. My father became a sad and lonely man when he began drinking. I suggest that you stop now before it drags you down. You are such a promising young man," she said.

The doctor wondered why he was standing and being given a temperance lecture by a seventy year old woman. Maybe she was right, but what business was it of hers to chide him this way? And what of his promise. Where had it gotten him thus far? In truth, the doctor was made of nothing but promise, but promise built on promise can really be nothing more than a facade of potential.

"Rita, what did you need?"

"Need? Oh, yes, of course. I finally heard from my nephew. He is coming to get me tomorrow."

"Where are you going?"

"Well, that's none of your business now, is it?"

"But what about your illness and the radio quiet zone?"

"I think that I will make do. I'm sure that I can find a new facility. I just feel that the...tone...has changed here."

"I suppose you are right."

The next day, Rita's nephew did, in fact, come to get her. The large man didn't say a word as he carried down the old woman's suitcases to his car. That left one less person in Salubrious than the day before.

For some reason, Rita's departure prompted the others to leave as well. Within a week, Salubrious was empty. The doctor's grand venture to heal the world of its electromagnetic sickness, to bring new frontiers of medical discovery and care to the radio quiet zone, had failed. The doctor was realistic enough to admit this to himself. He always had a keen sense of when it was time to cut his losses and move on to another project.

He didn't have a clear sense of what that project might be. He began to feel that maybe the doctor had lived out his useful life. Maybe it was time for the doctor to retire. But how best to retire? The doctor had, in fact, done quite a bit. Was maybe even known in this place and that? Could he simply retire, fade into obscurity and not be noticed?

Perhaps even more pressing was the question of Henry and Deana. He didn't want them to track him down and find him if he did try to start over. If he was leaving Salubrious behind, then he wanted to leave it all behind, including them.

Leaving them behind would be more difficult than he thought. That same evening, as plans for forcing the doctor into retirement raced through his mind, he was startled by the sound of glass breaking. Then more glass broke. Someone was breaking bottles? He looked out of the window and didn't see anything out of the front of the house. He walked to the back rooms and saw in the back yard Henry and Deana with bat and what looked to be bricks.

He saw Deana pick up a brick and hurl it at the house. It must have missed a window and landed with a dumb thud against the side of the house. Henry was banging away on the house like a dervish. The doctor raced downstairs. He really was less worried about the house than he was about having he police called out.

"What are you doing?" he yelled as he launched out the back door.

"Why, it's the esteemed doctor!" Henry yelled. Deana picked up a brick and chucked it at the doctor. She missed--her aim was very bad. She threw another, but the doctor dodged it. 

"What in the hell are you doing?"

"Getting even!" Deana grunted as she threw another brick.

"Will you just come inside please!? Let's settle this inside."

"You can't trick us into being fools," Deana shouted again. Another cascade of bricks came the doctor's way.

"Fine!" he said, marching back inside. He rushed upstairs to the attic, He pried up one of the floor boards up there where he had stowed away a gun. When he came back down, the infernal couple was sitting in the grass panting from their exertions. They both jumped up when the doctor started to wave the gun at them.

"Where did you get that!?" Deana started to hurl herself at him in her usual way, but reared back when the doctor trained the gun on her. He wasn't sure if he would really pull the trigger on her. He certainly wanted to but his plans would get mighty complicated fast.

"Now calm down, the both of you an come inside." Like scolded children, they both slouched inside the house. The doctor waved them to the kitchen table with the gun. "Sit. Sit down and tell me what you want. What can I do to make you go away?"

"We want the money," Deana said.

"What money?" the doctor replied.

"Oh, come on now doctor. You know that I'm sharper than that. I have eyes. I see things. And I've been talking more and more to him," she pointed to Henry. "We've become even better friends lately."

"It's funny how sleeping in alleys will bond two people," Henry muttered.

"What's that Henry," the doctor asked. He wanted to poke the man with the gun, but continued to restrain these impulses.

"I said that we have really bonded in our exile."

"Yeah, fallen people have to stick together. And to make things go a little better for us, we want the money."

The doctor looked at them square in the eye and said, "I don't know what you are talking about."

Deana, seemingly not caring about the doctor's gun, leaped up and yelled, "Like hell, you don't. Henry told me all about the racket you had going on here. How you lifted and fenced all kinds of things from people. What's going to happen when that little old lady's nephew realizes that she doesn't have any money left because this one ripped it all out of the lining of her suitcase. Do think he'll play the generous host? I bet he'll be back here for you!"

"So, believe these wild stories that he told you?"

"I do. I also think that we have been painstakingly writing them up..."

"The library has a pretty fine old computer that I fixed up nice for them. They've been letting me use it."

"We have a whole series of letters written up, waiting to be printed out."

"I see. And so you are blackmailing me?"

"Yes, that's about right."

"Then I seem to have no choice, do I?"

"I don't think so."

"Okay, then, come upstairs."

"I told you he was hiding it upstairs. We could have just broken in..."

"But smashing up the house was more fun, wasn't it?" Henry replied.

When they go upstairs, the doctor pointed them to the closet of his room where a steep narrow staircase led up the attic. He followed the both of them up, grabbing his pillow as they went. He groped for the light's chain and finally lit up the attic. The whole space was filled with garbage--old doors and windows, chests, broken coat racks, scraps of paper. All of it useless and outmoded, but kept around for whatever reason.

The doctor pointed them towards the far end of the attic and said, "Under the floor boards."

They both started ripping up the floor board with abandon. The doctor pulled out the gun from his pocket and wrapped the pillow around it. Henry was the first to look up at see him. "So, you're going to shoot us, doctor? Is this the end of my treatment?"

Deana stopped scooping him and stacking the piles of cash that had been neatly laid in the between the joists. "He's not going to shoot us, keep getting the money out."

Henry stood up, "Maybe I want him to shoot me. Maybe that's what I've wanted all along." He stepped closer and closer to the doctor. He was standing with the gun pressed against his stomach now. "Go ahead and shoot me, doctor." The doctor pulled back the gun's hammer. The barrel rotated and clicked as the bullet entered the chamber. He put pressure on the trigger, started to pull it back. "That's right, but that bullet in my gut. I know that you want to."

Deana called after him like a mother, "Henry, quit being a fool and help me. I'd like to get out of this dusty hole soon."

"Not until he shoots me."

"I'm not going to shoot you," Dr. Conroy finally conceded. "I want you to leave and never come looking for me"

"We're leaving now," Deana said. She grabbed Henry and they climbed down the attic stairs. From the attic window, he watched them as they walked clumsily down the middle of the street with their piles of other people's money.

***

Later that night, Dr. Conroy put his plan in motion. He moved through the house for the last time, looking over the space, making sure nothing seemed out of place. He wanted to make sure that an air of complete normalcy hung over everything. He turned off all of the lights, closed the door behind him and crossed the lawn to the garage. 

He hadn't used his car in a few months and it was covered in a generous layer of dust. He unlatched and open the wide swinging garage doors, started up the car, and pull out of the garage. With the garage closed back up, he drove through town. He had liked living in Ruston. Even though it was remote and extremely disconnected from the modern world, he enjoyed feeling that he was the center of something. With so many people flooding into Ruston, there were so many opportunities, so much potential.

As he drove, he chided himself for not being able to capitalize on the change that he found himself in the midst of. Maybe if he had been a little more focused, a little more determined, then he could have really realized him ambition. Instead, he was driving alone in the middle of the night to the mountains.

He knew that there was a perfect little metal bridge that crossed a mountain creek in the mountains. He could picture the bridge and the creek. That was where he was going. Dr. Conroy could already hear the rushing running water beneath the bridge and feel the cold metal of the bridge under his feet. Dr. Conroy would stand on the bridge and watch the white foam of the current break over the rocks below.

He approached the bridge slowly in the car, dimmed the lights and rolled on to the bridge's grated deck. He pulled the car over. Already Dr. Conroy was getting out of the car, could feel the late night wind moving through his hair. He got out of he car. Indeed, the sound of water was below him. There was the creek and the rocks and the water.

He walked around the car, inspecting it, looking at it. He stopped in front of the hood and scrawled in the dust with his finger, "Suicide is painless." As he walked away, there was Dr. Conroy climbing the girders, looking down. He stopped crossed to the other side, removed his suit jacket and released it over the side of the bridge.

Leaving Dr. Conroy like that, he kept walking, and would continue to walk until he crossed out of the radio quiet zone. He would probably find a convenience store somewhere, buy a cheap cell phone, and get connected with the world of waves and signals and things. He would also have to find a truck stop, shower up, maybe hitch a ride somewhere. New clothing would be nice. If the weather hadn't been so cold, he would have left more behind with Dr. Conroy. As it was, he was concerned about catching a chill in the damp, windy cold night.

Dr. Conroy was ready to leap. Meanwhile he was walking faster and faster down the road, careful to stay on the hard pavement and not veer off on to the side. He could hear Dr. Conroy leap, and he leaped and died there in the painless way that he predicted on the hood of his car.


## LEAVING THE LAST REFUGEE

Martha knew that she would have to leave now. She didn't expect, however, to be escorted out of the radio quiet zone by the man in the white hat. He found her in the horse barn, sobbing with her head up against her favorite horse. He stood outside the pen until she noticed him. She walked meekly past him and headed for the yellow truck.

When she saw him standing there, she knew what it meant. Her interests and his no longer aligned. What this meant for their concern with Anthony Charles would be difficult to discern in the complex of intentions and desires that fueled them both. For a span of time, they had both laid claim to Anthony's time and attention, both claimed a kind of special status in the man's life. For much of that time, their claims coexisted happily, but not so much now. 

Martha knew that the man in white hat knew. She also knew that she had no alternative now but the leave with him. He wasn't a wound up coil of violence about to spring on her. He merely represented the cold hard empirical fact of her crime and is consequences. He was there to carry out the logic of these facts with an implacable, unbendable force.

Oddly enough, she felt like she couldn't blame him for banning her from the radio quiet zone, for protecting its frontiers from people like her. She had told that young man that she was no longer sure why she came there. It was true. She had come for health and peace of mind. Now if she stayed, it would be under conditions of imprisonment and of fear. How could she live like that?

Could she start over her life? Where would she turn now? The one person she had considered home was dead and she had done it. Of course, there was the very real possibility--one which Martha did not really entrain--that her crime would catch up with her. Somehow she assumed that my meekly following the man with the white hat, that her crime could not follow her out of the radio quiet zone.

It was as if she had come away with the idea that everything in the queit zone was detected and recording, everything was pulled in to be analyzed and examined, and yet nothing was broadcast out. This applied to space emissions as well as sin.

As they drove in the car, the man in the white hat started talking to her, starting off with, "That was a pretty dumb thing that you did."

"I guess."

"It isn't going to be easy to deal with."

"You're probably right."

"But it will be best if you aren't here. Maybe you can just disappear for a while. Ever wanted to be someone else?"

"All the time..."

It was the first time that she had heard him laugh. "Yeah, well, it ain't easy. I've seen everyone--from the dumbest son of a bitch you can imagine to folks with fancy degrees--try to outrun their decisions, their fate. It hasn't happened yet for any of those people. And I haven't decided where in that line up of people you stand."

"I guess I don't know myself."

"I suppose you don't."

The man in the white hat dropped her off at a truck stop, gave her some money, and drove off, back into the radio quiet zone. She sat sipping at the coffee watching the tired truckers trying to wake up over their own coffee and breakfast. One by one they began to leave to return to their runs and back to whatever they called their lives.

She sat there alone for a little while longer before deciding to play one of the video poker machines by the rest rooms. She positioned herself in front of one made up to look like scenes from the Tarot, or so she thought. Most prominent of all was a jaunty man dressed in a tunic with a little dog yelping at his side. This figure dominated the side of the machine's cabinet. She played for a little while, won some money, lost some money, and got bored with playing rather quickly.

She got up to leave and bumped into someone. It took her a moment to recognize the man whom she was staring at now. It was the doctor that she had meet in Ruston. He seemed changed--tired and harassed, much like herself. His hair was wet and he smelled like cheap after shave.

Rather than smiling and greeting her, though, he disentangled him from her and walked by her quickly. Why doesn't he want to acknowledge me? she wondered. Does he know?

She followed him outside and found him circling around to the back fo the truck stop, maybe trying to avoid her. They collided again, this time he grabbed hold of her. "Why are you following me? Why are you here?"

"No reason. I'm not following you."

"You don't know me, do you understand?" She shook her head. "As for you, I don't know why you're here and don't want to know."

"But I..." He pressed his index finger insistently to his lips. She lowered his hand, "I'm running away too. I need to leave the quiet zone. I need to disappear." 

She must have broken his resolve because he sat down on a crumbled parking block, running his fingers through his hair. "This is complicated. I don't want complicated." He looked up at her, "You'll need a different name..."
